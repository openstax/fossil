<p id="fs-idp109649680">The hybrid orbital model appears to account well for the geometry of molecules involving single covalent bonds. Is it also capable of describing molecules containing double and triple bonds? We have already discussed that multiple bonds consist of &#963; and &#960; bonds. Next we can consider how we visualize these components and how they relate to hybrid orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, shows us that each carbon atom is surrounded by one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-idp52367024">In an ethene molecule, the four hydrogen atoms and the two carbon atoms are all in the same plane. If the two planes of <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals tilted relative to each other, the <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals would not be oriented to overlap efficiently to create the &#960; bond. The planar configuration for the ethene molecule occurs because it is the most stable bonding arrangement. This is a significant difference between &#963; and &#960; bonds; rotation around single (&#963;) bonds occurs easily because the end-to-end orbital overlap does not depend on the relative orientation of the orbitals on each atom in the bond. In other words, rotation around the internuclear axis does not change the extent to which the &#963; bonding orbitals overlap because the bonding electron density is symmetric about the axis. Rotation about the internuclear axis is much more difficult for multiple bonds; however, this would drastically alter the off-axis overlap of the &#960; bonding orbitals, essentially breaking the &#960; bond.</p>

<p id="fs-idp135325968">Hybridization involves only &#963; bonds, lone pairs of electrons, and single unpaired electrons (radicals). Structures that account for these features describe the correct hybridization of the atoms. However, many structures also include resonance forms. Remember that resonance forms occur when various arrangements of &#960; bonds are possible. Since the arrangement of &#960; bonds involves only the unhybridized orbitals, resonance does not influence the assignment of hybridization.</p>
<p id="fs-idp155207440">For example, molecule benzene has two resonance forms (<a href="#CNX_Chem_08_03_C6H6" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). We can use either of these forms to determine that each of the carbon atoms is bonded to three other atoms with no lone pairs, so the correct hybridization is <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>2</sup>. The electrons in the unhybridized <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals form &#960; bonds. Neither resonance structure completely describes the electrons in the &#960; bonds. They are not located in one position or the other, but in reality are delocalized throughout the ring. Valence bond theory does not easily address delocalization. Bonding in molecules with resonance forms is better described by molecular orbital theory. (See the next module.)</p>

<p id="fs-idp78398192">Multiple bonds consist of a &#963; bond located along the axis between two atoms and one or two &#960; bonds. The &#963; bonds are usually formed by the overlap of hybridized atomic orbitals, while the &#960; bonds are formed by the side-by-side overlap of unhybridized orbitals. Resonance occurs when there are multiple unhybridized orbitals with the appropriate alignment to overlap, so the placement of &#960; bonds can vary.</p>
