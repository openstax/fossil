<para id="fs-idp54341648">Radioactive isotopes have the same chemical properties as stable isotopes of the same element, but they emit radiation, which can be detected. If we replace one (or more) atom(s) with radioisotope(s) in a compound, we can track them by monitoring their radioactive emissions. This type of compound is called a <term>radioactive tracer</term> (or <term>radioactive label</term>). Radioisotopes are used to follow the paths of biochemical reactions or to determine how a substance is distributed within an organism. Radioactive tracers are also used in many medical applications, including both diagnosis and treatment. They are used to measure engine wear, analyze the geological formation around oil wells, and much more.</para>
<para id="fs-idp247341312">Radioisotopes have revolutionized medical practice (see <link class="target-chapter" document="m68871">Appendix M</link>), where they are used extensively. Over 10 million nuclear medicine procedures and more than 100 million nuclear medicine tests are performed annually in the United States. Four typical examples of radioactive tracers used in medicine are technetium-99

. Damaged tissues in the heart, liver, and lungs absorb certain compounds of technetium-99 preferentially. After it is injected, the location of the technetium compound, and hence the damaged tissue, can be determined by detecting the γ rays emitted by the Tc-99 isotope. Thallium-201 (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_21_05_Thallium"/>) becomes concentrated in healthy heart tissue, so the two isotopes, Tc-99 and Tl-201, are used together to study heart tissue. Iodine-131 concentrates in the thyroid gland, the liver, and some parts of the brain. It can therefore be used to monitor goiter and treat thyroid conditions, such as Grave’s disease, as well as liver and brain tumors. Salt solutions containing compounds of sodium-24 are injected into the bloodstream to help locate obstructions to the flow of blood.</para><figure id="CNX_Chem_21_05_Thallium">

<para id="fs-idp117263328">Radioisotopes used in medicine typically have short half-lives—for example, the ubiquitous Tc-99m has a half-life of 6.01 hours. This makes Tc-99m essentially impossible to store and prohibitively expensive to transport, so it is made on-site instead. Hospitals and other medical facilities use Mo-99 (which is primarily extracted from U-235 fission products) to generate Tc-99. Mo-99 undergoes β decay with a half-life of 66 hours, and the Tc-99 is then chemically extracted (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_21_05_Tc-99"/>). The parent nuclide Mo-99 is part of a molybdate ion, <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mrow><m:mtext>MoO</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mn>4</m:mn></m:msub><m:msup><m:mrow/><m:mrow><m:mn>2−</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup><m:mo>;</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> when it decays, it forms the pertechnetate ion, <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mrow><m:mtext>TcO</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mn>4</m:mn></m:msub><m:msup><m:mrow/><m:mtext>−</m:mtext></m:msup><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> These two water-soluble ions are separated by column chromatography, with the higher charge molybdate ion adsorbing onto the alumina in the column, and the lower charge pertechnetate ion passing through the column in the solution.

<para id="fs-idp240963344">Radioisotopes can also be used, typically in higher doses than as a tracer, as treatment. <term>Radiation therapy</term> is the use of high-energy radiation to damage the DNA of cancer cells, which kills them or keeps them from dividing (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_21_05_RadTherapy"/>). A cancer patient may receive <term>external beam radiation therapy</term> delivered by a machine outside the body, or <term>internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy)</term> from a radioactive substance that has been introduced into the body. Note that <term>chemotherapy</term> is similar to internal radiation therapy in that the cancer treatment is injected into the body, but differs in that chemotherapy uses chemical rather than radioactive substances to kill the cancer cells.</para>

<para id="fs-idp7560688">Commercial applications of radioactive materials are equally diverse (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_21_05_UsesOfRad"/>). They include determining the thickness of films and thin metal sheets by exploiting the penetration power of various types of radiation. Flaws in metals used for structural purposes can be detected using high-energy gamma rays from cobalt-60 in a fashion similar to the way X-rays are used to examine the human body. In one form of pest control, flies are controlled by sterilizing male flies with γ radiation so that females breeding with them do not produce offspring.

<para id="fs-idp17699024">Compounds known as radioactive tracers can be used to follow reactions, track the distribution of a substance, diagnose and treat medical conditions, and much more. Other radioactive substances are helpful for controlling pests, visualizing structures, providing fire warnings, and for many other applications. Hundreds of millions of nuclear medicine tests and procedures, using a wide variety of radioisotopes with relatively short half-lives, are performed every year in the US. Most of these radioisotopes have relatively short half-lives; some are short enough that the radioisotope must be made on-site at medical facilities. Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells by damaging their DNA. The radiation used for this treatment may be delivered externally or internally.</para>
