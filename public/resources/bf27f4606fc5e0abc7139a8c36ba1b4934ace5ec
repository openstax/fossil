<p id="fs-id2325345">The skeletal muscles are divided into <span data-type="term">axial</span> (muscles of the trunk and head) and <span data-type="term">appendicular</span> (muscles of the arms and legs) categories. This system reflects the bones of the skeleton system, which are also arranged in this manner. The axial muscles are grouped based on location, function, or both. Some of the axial muscles may seem to blur the boundaries because they cross over to the appendicular skeleton. The first grouping of the axial muscles you will review includes the muscles of the head and neck, then you will review the muscles of the vertebral column, and finally you will review the oblique and rectus muscles.</p>

<p id="fs-id2928107">The origins of the muscles of facial expression are on the surface of the skull (remember, the origin of a muscle does not move). The insertions of these muscles have fibers intertwined with connective tissue and the dermis of the skin. Because the muscles insert in the skin rather than on bone, when they contract, the skin moves to create facial expression (<a href="#fig-ch11_03_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="fig-ch11_03_01"><div data-type="title">Muscles of Facial Expression </div><figcaption>Many of the muscles of facial expression insert into the skin surrounding the eyelids, nose and mouth, producing facial expressions by moving the skin rather than bones.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id2696967" data-alt="The left panel in this figure shows the anterior view of the facial muscles, and the right panel shows the lateral view.">

</figure><p id="fs-id2361275">The <span data-type="term">orbicularis oris</span> is a circular muscle that moves the lips, and the <span data-type="term">orbicularis oculi</span> is a circular muscle that closes the eye. The <span data-type="term">occipitofrontalis</span> muscle moves up the scalp and eyebrows. The muscle has a frontal belly and an occipital (near the occipital bone on the posterior part of the skull) belly. In other words, there is a muscle on the forehead (<span data-type="term">frontalis</span>) and one on the back of the head (<span data-type="term">occipitalis</span>), but there is no muscle across the top of the head. Instead, the two bellies are connected by a broad tendon called the <span data-type="term">epicranial aponeurosis</span>, or galea aponeurosis (galea = &#8220;apple&#8221;). The physicians originally studying human anatomy thought the skull looked like an apple.</p>
<p id="fs-id2500664">A large portion of the face is composed of the <span data-type="term">buccinator</span> muscle, which compresses the cheek. This muscle allows you to whistle, blow, and suck; and it contributes to the action of chewing.

Place your finger on your eyebrows at the point of the bridge of the nose. Raise your eyebrows as if you were surprised and lower your eyebrows as if you were frowning.

Tongue muscles can be extrinsic or intrinsic. Extrinsic tongue muscles insert into the tongue from outside origins, and the intrinsic tongue muscles insert into the tongue from origins within it. The extrinsic muscles move the whole tongue in different directions, whereas the intrinsic muscles allow the tongue to change its shape (such as, curling the tongue in a loop or flattening it).

<p id="fs-id2488758"><span data-type="title">Anesthesia and the Tongue Muscles</span>
Before surgery, a patient must be made ready for general anesthesia. The normal homeostatic controls of the body are put &#8220;on hold&#8221; so that the patient can be prepped for surgery. Control of respiration must be switched from the patient&#8217;s homeostatic control to the control of the anesthesiologist. The drugs used for anesthesia relax a majority of the body&#8217;s muscles.</p>
<p id="fs-id2419404">Among the muscles affected during general anesthesia are those that are necessary for breathing and moving the tongue. Under anesthesia, the tongue can relax and partially or fully block the airway, and the muscles of respiration may not move the diaphragm or chest wall. To avoid possible complications, the safest procedure to use on a patient is called endotracheal intubation. Placing a tube into the trachea allows the doctors to maintain a patient&#8217;s (open) airway to the lungs and seal the airway off from the oropharynx. Post-surgery, the anesthesiologist gradually changes the mixture of the gases that keep the patient unconscious, and when the muscles of respiration begin to function, the tube is removed. It still takes about 30 minutes for a patient to wake up, and for breathing muscles to regain control of respiration. After surgery, most people have a sore or scratchy throat for a few days.</p>

<p id="fs-id2455581">The head, attached to the top of the vertebral column, is balanced, moved, and rotated by the neck muscles (<a href="#tbl-ch11_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). When these muscles act unilaterally, the head rotates. When they contract bilaterally, the head flexes or extends. The major muscle that laterally flexes and rotates the head is the <span data-type="term">sternocleidomastoid</span>. In addition, both muscles working together are the flexors of the head. Place your fingers on both sides of the neck and turn your head to the left and to the right. You will feel the movement originate there.

</figure><p id="fs-id2586421">The <span data-type="term">erector spinae group</span> forms the majority of the muscle mass of the back and it is the primary extensor of the vertebral column. It controls flexion, lateral flexion, and rotation of the vertebral column, and maintains the lumbar curve. The erector spinae comprises the iliocostalis (laterally placed) group, the longissimus (intermediately placed) group, and the spinalis (medially placed) group.</p>
<p id="fs-id2419122">The <span data-type="term">iliocostalis group</span> includes the <span data-type="term">iliocostalis cervicis</span>, associated with the cervical region; the <span data-type="term">iliocostalis thoracis</span>, associated with the thoracic region; and the <span data-type="term">iliocostalis lumborum</span>, associated with the lumbar region. The three muscles of the <span data-type="term">longissimus group</span> are the <span data-type="term">longissimus capitis</span>, associated with the head region; the <span data-type="term">longissimus cervicis</span>, associated with the cervical region; and the <span data-type="term">longissimus thoracis</span>, associated with the thoracic region. The third group, the <span data-type="term">spinalis group</span>, comprises the <span data-type="term">spinalis capitis</span> (head region), the <span data-type="term">spinalis cervicis</span> (cervical region), and the <span data-type="term">spinalis thoracis</span> (thoracic region).</p>
<p id="fs-id2808964">The <span data-type="term">transversospinales</span> muscles run from the transverse processes to the spinous processes of the vertebrae. Similar to the erector spinae muscles, the semispinalis muscles in this group are named for the areas of the body with which they are associated. The semispinalis muscles include the <span data-type="term">semispinalis capitis</span>, the <span data-type="term">semispinalis cervicis</span>, and the <span data-type="term">semispinalis thoracis</span>. The <span data-type="term">multifidus</span> muscle of the lumbar region helps extend and laterally flex the vertebral column.</p>
<p id="fs-id2080091">Important in the stabilization of the vertebral column is the <span data-type="term">segmental muscle group</span>, which includes the interspinales and intertransversarii muscles. These muscles bring together the spinous and transverse processes of each consecutive vertebra. Finally, the <span data-type="term">scalene muscles</span> work together to flex, laterally flex, and rotate the head. They also contribute to deep inhalation. The scalene muscles include the <span data-type="term">anterior scalene</span> muscle (anterior to the middle scalene), the <span data-type="term">middle scalene</span> muscle (the longest, intermediate between the anterior and posterior scalenes), and the <span data-type="term">posterior scalene</span> muscle (the smallest, posterior to the middle scalene).</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2354188" class="summary"><h3 data-type="title">Chapter Review</h3>
<p id="fs-id2253683">Muscles are either axial muscles or appendicular. The axial muscles are grouped based on location, function, or both. Some axial muscles cross over to the appendicular skeleton. The muscles of the head and neck are all axial. The muscles in the face create facial expression by inserting into the skin rather than onto bone. Muscles that move the eyeballs are extrinsic, meaning they originate outside of the eye and insert onto it. Tongue muscles are both extrinsic and intrinsic. The genioglossus depresses the tongue and moves it anteriorly; the styloglossus lifts the tongue and retracts it; the palatoglossus elevates the back of the tongue; and the hyoglossus depresses and flattens it. The muscles of the anterior neck facilitate swallowing and speech, stabilize the hyoid bone and position the larynx. The muscles of the neck stabilize and move the head. The sternocleidomastoid divides the neck into anterior and posterior triangles.</p>
<p id="fs-id1953872">The muscles of the back and neck that move the vertebral column are complex, overlapping, and can be divided into five groups. The splenius group includes the splenius capitis and the splenius cervicis. The erector spinae has three subgroups. The iliocostalis group includes the iliocostalis cervicis, the iliocostalis thoracis, and the iliocostalis lumborum. The longissimus group includes the longissimus capitis, the longissimus cervicis, and the longissimus thoracis. The spinalis group includes the spinalis capitis, the spinalis cervicis, and the spinalis thoracis. The transversospinales include the semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervicis, semispinalis thoracis, multifidus, and rotatores. The segmental muscles include the interspinales and intertransversarii. Finally, the scalenes include the anterior scalene, middle scalene, and posterior scalene.</p>
