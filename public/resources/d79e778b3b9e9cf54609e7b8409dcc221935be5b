<p id="fs-idp100544560">Over 90% of naturally occurring and man-made solids are crystalline. Most solids form with a regular arrangement of their particles because the overall attractive interactions between particles are maximized, and the total intermolecular energy is minimized, when the particles pack in the most efficient manner. The regular arrangement at an atomic level is often reflected at a macroscopic level. In this module, we will explore some of the details about the structures of metallic and ionic crystalline solids, and learn how these structures are determined experimentally.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp80429552"><h3 data-type="title">The Structures of Metals</h3>
<p id="fs-idp31452144">We will begin our discussion of crystalline solids by considering elemental metals, which are relatively simple because each contains only one type of atom. A pure metal is a crystalline solid with metal atoms packed closely together in a repeating pattern. Some of the properties of metals in general, such as their malleability and ductility, are largely due to having identical atoms arranged in a regular pattern. The different properties of one metal compared to another partially depend on the sizes of their atoms and the specifics of their spatial arrangements. We will explore the similarities and differences of four of the most common metal crystal geometries in the sections that follow.</p>

<p id="fs-idm2181616">The structure of a crystalline solid, whether a metal or not, is best described by considering its simplest repeating unit, which is referred to as its <span data-type="term">unit cell</span>. The unit cell consists of lattice points that represent the locations of atoms or ions. The entire structure then consists of this unit cell repeating in three dimensions, as illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Chem_10_06_UnitCell1" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp68860560">Let us begin our investigation of crystal lattice structure and unit cells with the most straightforward structure and the most basic unit cell. To visualize this, imagine taking a large number of identical spheres, such as tennis balls, and arranging them uniformly in a container. The simplest way to do this would be to make layers in which the spheres in one layer are directly above those in the layer below, as illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Chem_10_06_SimpleCub1" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. This arrangement is called <span data-type="term">simple cubic structure</span>, and the unit cell is called the <span data-type="term">simple cubic unit cell</span> or primitive cubic unit cell.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_10_06_SimpleCub1" class="scaled-down"><figcaption>When metal atoms are arranged with spheres in one layer directly above or below spheres in another layer, the lattice structure is called simple cubic. Note that the spheres are in contact.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idm2044016">In a simple cubic structure, the spheres are not packed as closely as they could be, and they only &#8220;fill&#8221; about 52% of the volume of the container. This is a relatively inefficient arrangement, and only one metal (polonium, Po) crystallizes in a simple cubic structure. As shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_10_06_SimpleCub2" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, a solid with this type of arrangement consists of planes (or layers) in which each atom contacts only the four nearest neighbors in its layer; one atom directly above it in the layer above; and one atom directly below it in the layer below. The number of other particles that each particle in a crystalline solid contacts is known as its <span data-type="term">coordination number</span>. For a polonium atom in a simple cubic array, the coordination number is, therefore, six.</p>

<p id="fs-idp178963488">Because closer packing maximizes the overall attractions between atoms and minimizes the total intermolecular energy, the atoms in most metals pack in this manner. We find two types of closest packing in simple metallic crystalline structures: CCP, which we have already encountered, and <span data-type="term">hexagonal closest packing (HCP)</span> shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_10_06_ClstPckng2" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Both consist of repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. In both types, a second layer (B) is placed on the first layer (A) so that each atom in the second layer is in contact with three atoms in the first layer. The third layer is positioned in one of two ways. In HCP, atoms in the third layer are directly above atoms in the first layer (i.e., the third layer is also type A), and the stacking consists of alternating type A and type B close-packed layers (i.e., ABABAB&#8943;). In CCP, atoms in the third layer are not above atoms in either of the first two layers (i.e., the third layer is type C), and the stacking consists of alternating type A, type B, and type C close-packed layers (i.e., ABCABCABC&#8943;). About two&#8211;thirds of all metals crystallize in closest-packed arrays with coordination numbers of 12.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp29462288"><h3 data-type="title">The Structures of Ionic Crystals</h3>
<p id="fs-idp123644576">Ionic crystals consist of two or more different kinds of ions that usually have different sizes. The packing of these ions into a crystal structure is more complex than the packing of metal atoms that are the same size.</p>
<p id="fs-idp192354256">Most monatomic ions behave as charged spheres, and their attraction for ions of opposite charge is the same in every direction. Consequently, stable structures for ionic compounds result (1) when ions of one charge are surrounded by as many ions as possible of the opposite charge and (2) when the cations and anions are in contact with each other. Structures are determined by two principal factors: the relative sizes of the ions and the ratio of the numbers of positive and negative ions in the compound.</p>
<p id="fs-idp1330336">In simple ionic structures, we usually find the anions, which are normally larger than the cations, arranged in a closest-packed array. (As seen previously, additional electrons attracted to the same nucleus make anions larger and fewer electrons attracted to the same nucleus make cations smaller when compared to the atoms from which they are formed.) The smaller cations commonly occupy one of two types of <span data-type="term">holes</span> (or interstices) remaining between the anions. The smaller of the holes is found between three anions in one plane and one anion in an adjacent plane. The four anions surrounding this hole are arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron, so the hole is called a <span data-type="term">tetrahedral hole</span>. The larger type of hole is found at the center of six anions (three in one layer and three in an adjacent layer) located at the corners of an octahedron; this is called an <span data-type="term">octahedral hole</span>. <a href="#CNX_Chem_10_06_TetOctHole" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates both of these types of holes.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_10_06_TetOctHole" class="scaled-down"><figcaption>Cations may occupy two types of holes between anions: octahedral holes or tetrahedral holes.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idp44872240">Depending on the relative sizes of the cations and anions, the cations of an ionic compound may occupy tetrahedral or octahedral holes, as illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Chem_10_06_IntIonst" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Relatively small cations occupy tetrahedral holes, and larger cations occupy octahedral holes. If the cations are too large to fit into the octahedral holes, the anions may adopt a more open structure, such as a simple cubic array. The larger cations can then occupy the larger cubic holes made possible by the more open spacing.</p>

Cesium chloride, CsCl, (illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Chem_10_07_CsClStrctr" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) is an example of this, with Cs<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> having radii of 174 pm and 181 pm, respectively. We can think of this as chloride ions forming a simple cubic unit cell, with a cesium ion in the center; or as cesium ions forming a unit cell with a chloride ion in the center; or as simple cubic unit cells formed by Cs<sup>+</sup> ions overlapping unit cells formed by Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> ions. Cesium ions and chloride ions touch along the body diagonals of the unit cells. One cesium ion and one chloride ion are present per unit cell, giving the l:l stoichiometry required by the formula for cesium chloride.

<p id="fs-idp1774112">The discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 by Francis <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Crick</span> and James <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Watson</span> is one of the great achievements in the history of science. They were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, along with Maurice <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Wilkins</span>, who provided experimental proof of DNA&#8217;s structure. British chemist Rosalind <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Franklin</span> made invaluable contributions to this monumental achievement through her work in measuring X-ray diffraction images of DNA. Early in her career, Franklin&#8217;s research on the structure of coals proved helpful to the British war effort. After shifting her focus to biological systems in the early 1950s, Franklin and doctoral student Raymond Gosling discovered that DNA consists of two forms: a long, thin fiber formed when wet (type &#8220;B&#8221;) and a short, wide fiber formed when dried (type &#8220;A&#8221;). Her X-ray diffraction images of DNA (<a href="#CNX_Chem_10_06_RFranklin" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) provided the crucial information that allowed Watson and Crick to confirm that DNA forms a double helix, and to determine details of its size and structure. Franklin also conducted pioneering research on viruses and the RNA that contains their genetic information, uncovering new information that radically changed the body of knowledge in the field. After developing ovarian cancer, Franklin continued to work until her death in 1958 at age 37. Among many posthumous recognitions of her work, the Chicago Medical School of Finch University of Health Sciences changed its name to the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in 2004, and adopted an image of her famous X-ray diffraction image of DNA as its official university logo.</p>

<p id="fs-idp129498528">The structures of crystalline metals and simple ionic compounds can be described in terms of packing of spheres. Metal atoms can pack in hexagonal closest-packed structures, cubic closest-packed structures, body-centered structures, and simple cubic structures. The anions in simple ionic structures commonly adopt one of these structures, and the cations occupy the spaces remaining between the anions. Small cations usually occupy tetrahedral holes in a closest-packed array of anions. Larger cations usually occupy octahedral holes. Still larger cations can occupy cubic holes in a simple cubic array of anions. The structure of a solid can be described by indicating the size and shape of a unit cell and the contents of the cell. The type of structure and dimensions of the unit cell can be determined by X-ray diffraction measurements.</p>
