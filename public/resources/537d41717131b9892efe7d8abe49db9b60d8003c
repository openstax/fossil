<p id="fs-id1883574">Throughout this chapter, we will express embryonic and fetal ages in terms of weeks from fertilization, commonly called conception. The period of time required for full development of a fetus in utero is referred to as <span data-type="term">gestation</span> (gestare = &#8220;to carry&#8221; or &#8220;to bear&#8221;). It can be subdivided into distinct gestational periods. The first 2 weeks of prenatal development are referred to as the pre-embryonic stage. A developing human is referred to as an <span data-type="term">embryo</span> during weeks 3&#8211;8, and a <span data-type="term">fetus</span> from the ninth week of gestation until birth. In this section, we&#8217;ll cover the pre-embryonic and embryonic stages of development, which are characterized by cell division, migration, and differentiation. By the end of the embryonic period, all of the organ systems are structured in rudimentary form, although the organs themselves are either nonfunctional or only semi-functional.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1904730"><h3 data-type="title">Pre-implantation Embryonic Development</h3>
<p id="fs-id1415291">Following fertilization, the zygote and its associated membranes, together referred to as the <span data-type="term">conceptus</span>, continue to be projected toward the uterus by peristalsis and beating cilia. During its journey to the uterus, the zygote undergoes five or six rapid mitotic cell divisions. Although each <span data-type="term">cleavage</span> results in more cells, it does not increase the total volume of the conceptus (<a href="#fig-ch29_02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Each daughter cell produced by cleavage is called a <span data-type="term">blastomere</span> (blastos = &#8220;germ,&#8221; in the sense of a seed or sprout).</p>
<p id="fs-id2347724">Approximately 3 days after fertilization, a 16-cell conceptus reaches the uterus. The cells that had been loosely grouped are now compacted and look more like a solid mass. The name given to this structure is the <span data-type="term">morula</span> (morula = &#8220;little mulberry&#8221;). Once inside the uterus, the conceptus floats freely for several more days. It continues to divide, creating a ball of approximately 100 cells, and consuming nutritive endometrial secretions called uterine milk while the uterine lining thickens. The ball of now tightly bound cells starts to secrete fluid and organize themselves around a fluid-filled cavity, the <span data-type="term">blastocoel</span>. At this developmental stage, the conceptus is referred to as a <span data-type="term">blastocyst</span>. Within this structure, a group of cells forms into an <span data-type="term">inner cell mass</span>, which is fated to become the embryo. The cells that form the outer shell are called <span data-type="term">trophoblasts</span> (trophe = &#8220;to feed&#8221; or &#8220;to nourish&#8221;). These cells will develop into the chorionic sac and the fetal portion of the <span data-type="term">placenta</span> (the organ of nutrient, waste, and gas exchange between mother and the developing offspring).</p>
<p id="fs-id2590647">The inner mass of embryonic cells is totipotent during this stage, meaning that each cell has the potential to differentiate into any cell type in the human body. Totipotency lasts for only a few days before the cells&#8217; fates are set as being the precursors to a specific lineage of cells.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-id1700002">As the blastocyst forms, the trophoblast excretes enzymes that begin to degrade the zona pellucida. In a process called &#8220;hatching,&#8221; the conceptus breaks free of the zona pellucida in preparation for implantation.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2339512"><h3 data-type="title">Implantation</h3>
<p id="fs-id2264860">At the end of the first week, the blastocyst comes in contact with the uterine wall and adheres to it, embedding itself in the uterine lining via the trophoblast cells. Thus begins the process of <span data-type="term">implantation</span>, which signals the end of the pre-embryonic stage of development (<a href="#fig-ch29_02_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Implantation can be accompanied by minor bleeding. The blastocyst typically implants in the fundus of the uterus or on the posterior wall. However, if the endometrium is not fully developed and ready to receive the blastocyst, the blastocyst will detach and find a better spot. A significant percentage (50&#8211;75 percent) of blastocysts fail to implant; when this occurs, the blastocyst is shed with the endometrium during menses. The high rate of implantation failure is one reason why pregnancy typically requires several ovulation cycles to achieve.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch29_02_02"><div data-type="title">Pre-Embryonic Development </div><figcaption>Ovulation, fertilization, pre-embryonic development, and implantation occur at specific locations within the female reproductive system in a time span of approximately 1 week.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id1891025" data-alt="This figure shows the different stages in pre-embryonic development.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id2328738">When implantation succeeds and the blastocyst adheres to the endometrium, the superficial cells of the trophoblast fuse with each other, forming the <span data-type="term">syncytiotrophoblast</span>, a multinucleated body that digests endometrial cells to firmly secure the blastocyst to the uterine wall. In response, the uterine mucosa rebuilds itself and envelops the blastocyst (<a href="#fig-ch29_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The trophoblast secretes <span data-type="term">human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)</span>, a hormone that directs the corpus luteum to survive, enlarge, and continue producing progesterone and estrogen to suppress menses. These functions of hCG are necessary for creating an environment suitable for the developing embryo. As a result of this increased production, hCG accumulates in the maternal bloodstream and is excreted in the urine. Implantation is complete by the middle of the second week. Just a few days after implantation, the trophoblast has secreted enough hCG for an at-home urine pregnancy test to give a positive result.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch29_02_03"><div data-type="title">Implantation </div><figcaption>During implantation, the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst adhere to the endometrium and digest endometrial cells until it is attached securely.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id1617531" data-alt="This figure shows the different steps during implantation.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id2081047">Most of the time an embryo implants within the body of the uterus in a location that can support growth and development. However, in one to two percent of cases, the embryo implants either outside the uterus (an <span data-type="term">ectopic pregnancy</span>) or in a region of uterus that can create complications for the pregnancy. If the embryo implants in the inferior portion of the uterus, the placenta can potentially grow over the opening of the cervix, a condition call <span data-type="term">placenta previa</span>.</p>
<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id2623017" class="anatomy disorders" data-label=""><div data-type="title">Disorders of the&#8230;</div>
<p id="fs-id2797558"><span data-type="title">Development of the Embryo</span>
In the vast majority of ectopic pregnancies, the embryo does not complete its journey to the uterus and implants in the uterine tube, referred to as a tubal pregnancy. However, there are also ovarian ectopic pregnancies (in which the egg never left the ovary) and abdominal ectopic pregnancies (in which an egg was &#8220;lost&#8221; to the abdominal cavity during the transfer from ovary to uterine tube, or in which an embryo from a tubal pregnancy re-implanted in the abdomen). Once in the abdominal cavity, an embryo can implant into any well-vascularized structure&#8212;the rectouterine cavity (Douglas&#8217; pouch), the mesentery of the intestines, and the greater omentum are some common sites.</p>
<p id="fs-id2569765">Tubal pregnancies can be caused by scar tissue within the tube following a sexually transmitted bacterial infection. The scar tissue impedes the progress of the embryo into the uterus&#8212;in some cases &#8220;snagging&#8221; the embryo and, in other cases, blocking the tube completely. Approximately one half of tubal pregnancies resolve spontaneously. Implantation in a uterine tube causes bleeding, which appears to stimulate smooth muscle contractions and expulsion of the embryo. In the remaining cases, medical or surgical intervention is necessary. If an ectopic pregnancy is detected early, the embryo&#8217;s development can be arrested by the administration of the cytotoxic drug methotrexate, which inhibits the metabolism of folic acid. If diagnosis is late and the uterine tube is already ruptured, surgical repair is essential.</p>
<p id="fs-id2302851">Even if the embryo has successfully found its way to the uterus, it does not always implant in an optimal location (the fundus or the posterior wall of the uterus). Placenta previa can result if an embryo implants close to the internal os of the uterus (the internal opening of the cervix). As the fetus grows, the placenta can partially or completely cover the opening of the cervix (<a href="#fig-ch29_02_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Although it occurs in only 0.5 percent of pregnancies, placenta previa is the leading cause of antepartum hemorrhage (profuse vaginal bleeding after week 24 of pregnancy but prior to childbirth).</p>
<figure id="fig-ch29_02_04"><div data-type="title">Placenta Previa </div><figcaption>An embryo that implants too close to the opening of the cervix can lead to placenta previa, a condition in which the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id1356205" data-alt="The left panel of this image shows the normal location of the placenta and the right panel shows the location of the placenta in placenta previa.">

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2789978"><h3 data-type="title">Embryonic Membranes</h3>
<p id="fs-id1521962">During the second week of development, with the embryo implanted in the uterus, cells within the blastocyst start to organize into layers. Some grow to form the extra-embryonic membranes needed to support and protect the growing embryo: the amnion, the yolk sac, the allantois, and the chorion.</p>
<p id="fs-id1386527">At the beginning of the second week, the cells of the inner cell mass form into a two-layered disc of embryonic cells, and a space&#8212;the <span data-type="term">amniotic cavity</span>&#8212;opens up between it and the trophoblast (<a href="#fig-ch29_02_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Cells from the upper layer of the disc (the <span data-type="term">epiblast</span>) extend around the amniotic cavity, creating a membranous sac that forms into the <span data-type="term">amnion</span> by the end of the second week. The amnion fills with amniotic fluid and eventually grows to surround the embryo. Early in development, amniotic fluid consists almost entirely of a filtrate of maternal plasma, but as the kidneys of the fetus begin to function at approximately the eighth week, they add urine to the volume of amniotic fluid. Floating within the amniotic fluid, the embryo&#8212;and later, the fetus&#8212;is protected from trauma and rapid temperature changes. It can move freely within the fluid and can prepare for swallowing and breathing out of the uterus.</p>

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id2596103">On the ventral side of the embryonic disc, opposite the amnion, cells in the lower layer of the embryonic disk (the <span data-type="term">hypoblast</span>) extend into the blastocyst cavity and form a <span data-type="term">yolk sac</span>. The yolk sac supplies some nutrients absorbed from the trophoblast and also provides primitive blood circulation to the developing embryo for the second and third week of development. When the placenta takes over nourishing the embryo at approximately week 4, the yolk sac has been greatly reduced in size and its main function is to serve as the source of blood cells and germ cells (cells that will give rise to gametes). During week 3, a finger-like outpocketing of the yolk sac develops into the <span data-type="term">allantois</span>, a primitive excretory duct of the embryo that will become part of the urinary bladder. Together, the stalks of the yolk sac and allantois establish the outer structure of the umbilical cord.</p>
<p id="fs-id2093678">The last of the extra-embryonic membranes is the <span data-type="term">chorion</span>, which is the one membrane that surrounds all others. The development of the chorion will be discussed in more detail shortly, as it relates to the growth and development of the placenta.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1960660"><h3 data-type="title">Embryogenesis</h3>
<p id="fs-id2336777">As the third week of development begins, the two-layered disc of cells becomes a three-layered disc through the process of <span data-type="term">gastrulation</span>, during which the cells transition from totipotency to multipotency. The embryo, which takes the shape of an oval-shaped disc, forms an indentation called the <span data-type="term">primitive streak</span> along the dorsal surface of the epiblast. A node at the caudal or &#8220;tail&#8221; end of the primitive streak emits growth factors that direct cells to multiply and migrate. Cells migrate toward and through the primitive streak and then move laterally to create two new layers of cells. The first layer is the <span data-type="term">endoderm</span>, a sheet of cells that displaces the hypoblast and lies adjacent to the yolk sac. The second layer of cells fills in as the middle layer, or <span data-type="term">mesoderm</span>. The cells of the epiblast that remain (not having migrated through the primitive streak) become the <span data-type="term">ectoderm</span> (<a href="#fig-ch29_02_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id2632486">Each of these germ layers will develop into specific structures in the embryo. Whereas the ectoderm and endoderm form tightly connected epithelial sheets, the mesodermal cells are less organized and exist as a loosely connected cell community. The ectoderm gives rise to cell lineages that differentiate to become the central and peripheral nervous systems, sensory organs, epidermis, hair, and nails. Mesodermal cells ultimately become the skeleton, muscles, connective tissue, heart, blood vessels, and kidneys. The endoderm goes on to form the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and pancreas, as well as the lungs (<a href="#fig-ch29_02_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2580526"><h3 data-type="title">Development of the Placenta</h3>
<p id="fs-id2347718">During the first several weeks of development, the cells of the endometrium&#8212;referred to as decidual cells&#8212;nourish the nascent embryo. During prenatal weeks 4&#8211;12, the developing placenta gradually takes over the role of feeding the embryo, and the decidual cells are no longer needed. The mature placenta is composed of tissues derived from the embryo, as well as maternal tissues of the endometrium. The placenta connects to the conceptus via the <span data-type="term">umbilical cord</span>, which carries deoxygenated blood and wastes from the fetus through two umbilical arteries; nutrients and oxygen are carried from the mother to the fetus through the single umbilical vein. The umbilical cord is surrounded by the amnion, and the spaces within the cord around the blood vessels are filled with Wharton&#8217;s jelly, a mucous connective tissue.</p>
<p id="fs-id2326118">The maternal portion of the placenta develops from the deepest layer of the endometrium, the decidua basalis. To form the embryonic portion of the placenta, the syncytiotrophoblast and the underlying cells of the trophoblast (cytotrophoblast cells) begin to proliferate along with a layer of extraembryonic mesoderm cells. These form the <span data-type="term">chorionic membrane</span>, which envelops the entire conceptus as the chorion. The chorionic membrane forms finger-like structures called <span data-type="term">chorionic villi</span> that burrow into the endometrium like tree roots, making up the fetal portion of the placenta. The cytotrophoblast cells perforate the chorionic villi, burrow farther into the endometrium, and remodel maternal blood vessels to augment maternal blood flow surrounding the villi. Meanwhile, fetal mesenchymal cells derived from the mesoderm fill the villi and differentiate into blood vessels, including the three umbilical blood vessels that connect the embryo to the developing placenta (<a href="#fig-ch29_02_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="fig-ch29_02_08"><div data-type="title">Cross-Section of the Placenta </div><figcaption>In the placenta, maternal and fetal blood components are conducted through the surface of the chorionic villi, but maternal and fetal bloodstreams never mix directly.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id2588223" data-alt="This figure shows the location and structure of the placenta.

</figure><p id="fs-id2268687">The placenta develops throughout the embryonic period and during the first several weeks of the fetal period; <span data-type="term">placentation</span> is complete by weeks 14&#8211;16. As a fully developed organ, the placenta provides nutrition and excretion, respiration, and endocrine function (<a href="#tbl-ch29_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#fig-ch29_02_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). It receives blood from the fetus through the umbilical arteries. Capillaries in the chorionic villi filter fetal wastes out of the blood and return clean, oxygenated blood to the fetus through the umbilical vein. Nutrients and oxygen are transferred from maternal blood surrounding the villi through the capillaries and into the fetal bloodstream. Some substances move across the placenta by simple diffusion. Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and any other lipid-soluble substances take this route. Other substances move across by facilitated diffusion. This includes water-soluble glucose. The fetus has a high demand for amino acids and iron, and those substances are moved across the placenta by active transport.</p>
<p id="fs-id2427601">Maternal and fetal blood does not commingle because blood cells cannot move across the placenta. This separation prevents the mother&#8217;s cytotoxic T cells from reaching and subsequently destroying the fetus, which bears &#8220;non-self&#8221; antigens. Further, it ensures the fetal red blood cells do not enter the mother&#8217;s circulation and trigger antibody development (if they carry &#8220;non-self&#8221; antigens)&#8212;at least until the final stages of pregnancy or birth. This is the reason that, even in the absence of preventive treatment, an Rh<sup>&#8722;</sup> mother doesn&#8217;t develop antibodies that could cause hemolytic disease in her first Rh<sup>+</sup> fetus.</p>
<p id="fs-id1689224">Although blood cells are not exchanged, the chorionic villi provide ample surface area for the two-way exchange of substances between maternal and fetal blood. The rate of exchange increases throughout gestation as the villi become thinner and increasingly branched. The placenta is permeable to lipid-soluble fetotoxic substances: alcohol, nicotine, barbiturates, antibiotics, certain pathogens, and many other substances that can be dangerous or fatal to the developing embryo or fetus. For these reasons, pregnant women should avoid fetotoxic substances. Alcohol consumption by pregnant women, for example, can result in a range of abnormalities referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These include organ and facial malformations, as well as cognitive and behavioral disorders.</p>

The tube lies atop a rod-shaped, mesoderm-derived <span data-type="term">notochord</span>, which eventually becomes the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs. Block-like structures called <span data-type="term">somites</span> form on either side of the tube, eventually differentiating into the axial skeleton, skeletal muscle, and dermis. During the fourth and fifth weeks, the anterior neural tube dilates and subdivides to form vesicles that will become the brain structures.</p>
<p id="fs-id2276996">Folate, one of the B vitamins, is important to the healthy development of the neural tube. A deficiency of maternal folate in the first weeks of pregnancy can result in neural tube defects, including spina bifida&#8212;a birth defect in which spinal tissue protrudes through the newborn&#8217;s vertebral column, which has failed to completely close. A more severe neural tube defect is anencephaly, a partial or complete absence of brain tissue.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-id2269746">The embryo, which begins as a flat sheet of cells, begins to acquire a cylindrical shape through the process of <span data-type="term">embryonic folding</span> (<a href="#fig-ch29_02_11" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The embryo folds laterally and again at either end, forming a C-shape with distinct head and tail ends. The embryo envelops a portion of the yolk sac, which protrudes with the umbilical cord from what will become the abdomen. The folding essentially creates a tube, called the primitive gut, that is lined by the endoderm. The amniotic sac, which was sitting on top of the flat embryo, envelops the embryo as it folds.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-id1230654">Within the first 8 weeks of gestation, a developing embryo establishes the rudimentary structures of all of its organs and tissues from the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. This process is called <span data-type="term">organogenesis</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-id2717095">Like the central nervous system, the heart also begins its development in the embryo as a tube-like structure, connected via capillaries to the chorionic villi. Cells of the primitive tube-shaped heart are capable of electrical conduction and contraction. The heart begins beating in the beginning of the fourth week, although it does not actually pump embryonic blood until a week later, when the oversized liver has begun producing red blood cells. (This is a temporary responsibility of the embryonic liver that the bone marrow will assume during fetal development.) During weeks 4&#8211;5, the eye pits form, limb buds become apparent, and the rudiments of the pulmonary system are formed.</p>
<p id="fs-id1490848">During the sixth week, uncontrolled fetal limb movements begin to occur. The gastrointestinal system develops too rapidly for the embryonic abdomen to accommodate it, and the intestines temporarily loop into the umbilical cord. Paddle-shaped hands and feet develop fingers and toes by the process of apoptosis (programmed cell death), which causes the tissues between the fingers to disintegrate. By week 7, the facial structure is more complex and includes nostrils, outer ears, and lenses (<a href="#fig-ch29_02_12" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). By the eighth week, the head is nearly as large as the rest of the embryo&#8217;s body, and all major brain structures are in place. The external genitalia are apparent, but at this point, male and female embryos are indistinguishable. Bone begins to replace cartilage in the embryonic skeleton through the process of ossification. By the end of the embryonic period, the embryo is approximately 3 cm (1.2 in) from crown to rump and weighs approximately 8 g (0.25 oz).</p>

<p id="fs-id1378418">As the zygote travels toward the uterus, it undergoes numerous cleavages in which the number of cells doubles (blastomeres). Upon reaching the uterus, the conceptus has become a tightly packed sphere of cells called the morula, which then forms into a blastocyst consisting of an inner cell mass within a fluid-filled cavity surrounded by trophoblasts. The blastocyst implants in the uterine wall, the trophoblasts fuse to form a syncytiotrophoblast, and the conceptus is enveloped by the endometrium. Four embryonic membranes form to support the growing embryo: the amnion, the yolk sac, the allantois, and the chorion. The chorionic villi of the chorion extend into the endometrium to form the fetal portion of the placenta. The placenta supplies the growing embryo with oxygen and nutrients; it also removes carbon dioxide and other metabolic wastes.</p>
<p id="fs-id1534502">Following implantation, embryonic cells undergo gastrulation, in which they differentiate and separate into an embryonic disc and establish three primary germ layers (the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm). Through the process of embryonic folding, the fetus begins to take shape. Neurulation starts the process of the development of structures of the central nervous system and organogenesis establishes the basic plan for all organ systems.</p>
