The textbook follows the scope and sequence of most Human Anatomy and Physiology courses, and its coverage and organization were informed by hundreds of instructors who teach the course.  Instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.  
The artwork for this textbook is aimed focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations.   Color is used sparingly, to emphasize the most important aspects of any given illustration.  Significant use of micrographs from the University of Michigan complement the illustrations, and provide the students with a meaningful alternate depiction of each concept.  Finally, enrichment elements provide relevance and deeper context for students, particularly in the areas of health, disease, and information relevant to their intended careers.</div>
  <p id="delete_me">Welcome to <em data-effect="italics">Anatomy and Physiology</em>, an OpenStax resource.

The development choices for this textbook were made with the guidance of hundreds of faculty who are deeply involved in teaching this course. These choices led to innovations in art, terminology, career orientation, practical applications, and multimedia-based learning, all with a goal of increasing relevance to students. We strove to make the discipline meaningful and memorable to students, so that they can draw from it a working knowledge that will enrich their future studies.
</p><section data-depth="3" id="eip-217"><h5 data-type="title">Unit 1: Levels of Organization </h5><p id="eip-719">Chapters 1&#8211;4 provide students with a basic understanding of human anatomy and physiology, including its language, the levels of organization, and the basics of chemistry and cell biology.

Throughout the text, you will find features that engage the students by taking selected topics a step further. 
</p><ul id="eip-641" data-bullet-style="none"><li><strong>Homeostatic Imbalances</strong> discusses the effects and results of imbalances in the body.</li>
<li><strong>Disorders</strong> showcases a disorder that is relevant to the body system at hand. This feature may focus on a specific disorder or a set of related disorders.</li>
<li><strong>Diseases</strong> showcases a disease that is relevant to the body system at hand.</li>
<li><strong>Aging</strong> explores the effect aging has on a body&#8217;s system and specific disorders that manifest over time. </li>
<li><strong>Career Connections</strong> presents information on the various careers often pursued by allied health students, such as medical technician, medical examiner, and neurophysiologist. Students are introduced to the educational requirements for and day-to-day responsibilities in these careers.</li>
<li><strong>Everyday Connections</strong> tie anatomical and physiological concepts to emerging issues and discuss these in terms of everyday life. Topics include &#8220;Anabolic Steroids&#8221; and &#8220;The Effect of Second-Hand Tobacco Smoke.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Links</strong> direct students to online exercises, simulations, animations, and videos to add a fuller context to core content and help improve understanding of the material. Many features include links to the University of Michigan&#8217;s interactive WebScopes, which allow students to zoom in on micrographs in the collection. These resources were vetted by reviewers and other subject matter experts to ensure that they are effective and accurate. We strongly urge students to explore these links, whether viewing a video or inputting data into a simulation, to gain the fullest experience and to learn how to search for information independently.  </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-72"><h4 data-type="title">Dynamic, Learner-Centered Art</h4><p id="eip-287">
Our unique approach to visuals is designed to emphasize only the components most important in any given illustration. The art style is particularly aimed at focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations.  
</p>

<p id="eip-id1167703115240">Much of the art in this book consists of black line illustrations. The strongest line is used to highlight the most important structures, and shading is used to show dimension and shape. Color is used sparingly to highlight and clarify the primary anatomical or functional point of the illustration. This technique is intended to draw students&#8217; attention to the critical learning point in the illustration, without distraction from excessive gradients, shadows, and highlights. Full color is used when the structure or process requires it (for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular system illustrations).

<p id="fs-idm629835024">By highlighting the most important portions of the illustration, the artwork helps students focus on the most important points without overwhelming them.</p>

Micrograph magnifications have been calculated based on the objective provided with the image. If a micrograph was recorded at 40&#215;, and the image was magnified an additional 2&#215;, we calculated the final magnification of the micrograph to be 80&#215;.
