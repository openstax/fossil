<p id="fs-idp42936208">As we know, a scientific theory is a strongly supported explanation for observed natural laws or large bodies of experimental data. For a theory to be accepted, it must explain experimental data and be able to predict behavior. For example, VSEPR theory has gained widespread acceptance because it predicts three-dimensional molecular shapes that are consistent with experimental data collected for thousands of different molecules. However, VSEPR theory does not provide an explanation of chemical bonding.</p>
<p id="fs-idp41602432">There are successful theories that describe the electronic structure of atoms. We can use quantum mechanics to predict the specific regions around an atom where electrons are likely to be located: A spherical shape for an <em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital, a dumbbell shape for a <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe the regions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account for the electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are described by valence bond theory and hybridization.</p>
<p id="fs-idp56452464"><span data-type="term">Valence bond theory</span> describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled atomic orbitals (each containing a single electron) that yield a pair of electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two different atoms <span data-type="term">overlap</span> when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second orbital occupy the same region of space. According to valence bond theory, a covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each orbital combine to form an electron pair. The mutual attraction between this negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms&#8217; positively charged nuclei serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are stronger than those that have less overlap.</p>
<p id="fs-idp45162384">The energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap. <a href="#CNX_Chem_08_01_Morse" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored curve) changes as they approach each other. When the atoms are far apart there is no overlap, and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero. As the atoms move together, their orbitals begin to overlap. Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom. In addition, the electrons begin to repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still widely separated, the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions, and the energy of the system decreases. (A bond begins to form.) As the atoms move closer together, the overlap increases, so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase (as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei). At some specific distance between the atoms, which varies depending on the atoms involved, the energy reaches its lowest (most stable) value. This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is the bond distance between the two atoms. The bond is stable because at this point, the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration. If the distance between the nuclei were to decrease further, the repulsions between nuclei and the repulsions as electrons are confined in closer proximity to each other would become stronger than the attractive forces. The energy of the system would then rise (making the system destabilized), as shown at the far left of <a href="#CNX_Chem_08_01_Morse" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idm5865744">The bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the bond distance) and the energy of the two separated atoms. This is the quantity of energy released when the bond is formed. Conversely, the same amount of energy is required to break the bond.

<p id="fs-idp228190304">As seen in <a href="#fs-idp43355056" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, an average carbon-carbon single bond is 347 kJ/mol, while in a carbon-carbon double bond, the &#960; bond increases the bond strength by 267 kJ/mol. Adding an additional &#960; bond causes a further increase of 225 kJ/mol. We can see a similar pattern when we compare other &#963; and &#960; bonds. Thus, each individual &#960; bond is generally weaker than a corresponding &#963; bond between the same two atoms. In a &#963; bond, there is a greater degree of orbital overlap than in a &#960; bond.</p>

<p id="fs-idp52352272">Valence bond theory describes bonding as a consequence of the overlap of two separate atomic orbitals on different atoms that creates a region with one pair of electrons shared between the two atoms. When the orbitals overlap along an axis containing the nuclei, they form a &#963; bond. When they overlap in a fashion that creates a node along this axis, they form a &#960; bond.</p>

<p id="fs-idp274311280">Similarities: Both types of bonds result from overlap of atomic orbitals on adjacent atoms and contain a maximum of two electrons. Differences: &#963; bonds are stronger and result from end-to-end overlap and all single bonds are &#963; bonds; &#960; bonds between the same two atoms are weaker because they result from side-by-side overlap, and multiple bonds contain one or more &#960; bonds (in addition to a &#963; bond).</p>
