<p id="fs-idm66465552">Incorporation of an oxygen atom into carbon- and hydrogen-containing molecules leads to new functional groups and new families of compounds. When the oxygen atom is attached by single bonds, the molecule is either an alcohol or ether.</p>
<p id="fs-idm33604032"><span data-type="term">Alcohols</span> are derivatives of hydrocarbons in which an &#8211;OH group has replaced a hydrogen atom. Although all alcohols have one or more hydroxyl (&#8211;OH) functional groups, they do not behave like bases such as NaOH and KOH. NaOH and KOH are ionic compounds that contain OH<sup>&#8211;</sup> ions. Alcohols are covalent molecules; the &#8211;OH group in an alcohol molecule is attached to a carbon atom by a covalent bond.</p>
<p id="fs-idm13274688">Ethanol, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH, also called ethyl alcohol, is a particularly important alcohol for human use. Ethanol is the alcohol produced by some species of yeast that is found in wine, beer, and distilled drinks.

The carbon chain contains five carbon atoms. If the hydroxyl group was not present, we would have named this molecule pentane. To address the fact that the hydroxyl group is present, we change the ending of the name to <em data-effect="italics">-ol</em>. In this case, since the &#8211;OH is attached to carbon 2 in the chain, we would name this molecule 2-pentanol.</p>

<p id="fs-idm73541184">Carbohydrates are large biomolecules made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The dietary forms of carbohydrates are foods rich in these types of molecules, like pastas, bread, and candy. The name &#8220;carbohydrate&#8221; comes from the formula of the molecules, which can be described by the general formula C<sub>m</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>, which shows that they are in a sense &#8220;carbon and water&#8221; or &#8220;hydrates of carbon.&#8221; In many cases, <em data-effect="italics">m</em> and <em data-effect="italics">n</em> have the same value, but they can be different. The smaller carbohydrates are generally referred to as &#8220;sugars,&#8221; the biochemical term for this group of molecules is &#8220;saccharide&#8221; from the Greek word for sugar (<a href="#CNX_Chem_20_02_Sugars" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Depending on the number of sugar units joined together, they may be classified as monosaccharides (one sugar unit), disaccharides (two sugar units), oligosaccharides (a few sugars), or polysaccharides (the polymeric version of sugars&#8212;polymers were described in the feature box earlier in this chapter on recycling plastics). The scientific names of sugars can be recognized by the suffix <em data-effect="italics">-ose</em> at the end of the name (for instance, fruit sugar is a monosaccharide called &#8220;fructose&#8221; and milk sugar is a disaccharide called lactose composed of two monosaccharides, glucose and galactose, connected together). Sugars contain some of the functional groups we have discussed: Note the alcohol groups present in the structures and how monosaccharide units are linked to form a disaccharide by formation of an ether.</p>

<p id="fs-idm33645104">Organisms use carbohydrates for a variety of functions. Carbohydrates can store energy, such as the polysaccharides glycogen in animals or starch in plants. They also provide structural support, such as the polysaccharide cellulose in plants and the modified polysaccharide chitin in fungi and animals. The sugars ribose and deoxyribose are components of the backbones of RNA and DNA, respectively. Other sugars play key roles in the function of the immune system, in cell-cell recognition, and in many other biological roles.</p>
<p id="fs-idm20354000">Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has a high sugar concentration in their blood (<a href="#CNX_Chem_20_02_Diabetes" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Diabetes may be caused by insufficient insulin production by the pancreas or by the body&#8217;s cells not responding properly to the insulin that is produced. In a healthy person, insulin is produced when it is needed and functions to transport glucose from the blood into the cells where it can be used for energy. The long-term complications of diabetes can include loss of eyesight, heart disease, and kidney failure.</p>
<p id="fs-idm13367296">In 2013, it was estimated that approximately 3.3% of the world&#8217;s population (~380 million people) suffered from diabetes, resulting in over a million deaths annually. Prevention involves eating a healthy diet, getting plenty of exercise, and maintaining a normal body weight. Treatment involves all of these lifestyle practices and may require injections of insulin.</p>

<p id="fs-idm8778416">Many organic compounds that are not hydrocarbons can be thought of as derivatives of hydrocarbons. A hydrocarbon derivative can be formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon by a functional group, which contains at least one atom of an element other than carbon or hydrogen. The properties of hydrocarbon derivatives are determined largely by the functional group. The &#8211;OH group is the functional group of an alcohol. The &#8211;R&#8211;O&#8211;R&#8211; group is the functional group of an ether.</p>
