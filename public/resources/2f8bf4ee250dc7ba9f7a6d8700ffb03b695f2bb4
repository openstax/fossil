<p id="fs-idp51102864">Thus far, we have used two-dimensional Lewis structures to represent molecules. However, molecular structure is actually three-dimensional, and it is important to be able to describe molecular bonds in terms of their distances, angles, and relative arrangements in space (<a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_CH2O" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). A <span data-type="term">bond angle</span> is the angle between any two bonds that include a common atom, usually measured in degrees. A <span data-type="term">bond distance</span> (or bond length) is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms along the straight line joining the nuclei. Bond distances are measured in &#197;ngstroms (1 &#197; = 10<sup>&#8211;10</sup> m) or picometers (1 pm = 10<sup>&#8211;12</sup> m, 100 pm = 1 &#197;).</p>

<p id="fs-idp36050992"><span data-type="term">Valence shell electron-pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory)</span> enables us to predict the molecular structure, including approximate bond angles around a central atom, of a molecule from an examination of the number of bonds and lone electron pairs in its Lewis structure. The VSEPR model assumes that electron pairs in the valence shell of a central atom will adopt an arrangement that minimizes repulsions between these electron pairs by maximizing the distance between them. The electrons in the valence shell of a central atom form either bonding pairs of electrons, located primarily between bonded atoms, or lone pairs. The electrostatic repulsion of these electrons is reduced when the various regions of high electron density assume positions as far from each other as possible.</p>
<p id="fs-idp46353584">VSEPR theory predicts the arrangement of electron pairs around each central atom and, usually, the correct arrangement of atoms in a molecule. We should understand, however, that the theory only considers electron-pair repulsions. Other interactions, such as nuclear-nuclear repulsions and nuclear-electron attractions, are also involved in the final arrangement that atoms adopt in a particular molecular structure.</p>
<p id="fs-idp122770240">As a simple example of VSEPR theory, let us predict the structure of a gaseous BeF<sub>2</sub> molecule. The Lewis structure of BeF<sub>2</sub> (<a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_BeF2" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) shows only two electron pairs around the central beryllium atom. With two bonds and no lone pairs of electrons on the central atom, the bonds are as far apart as possible, and the electrostatic repulsion between these regions of high electron density is reduced to a minimum when they are on opposite sides of the central atom. The bond angle is 180&#176; (<a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_BeF2" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idp238100128">It is important to note that electron-pair geometry around a central atom is <em data-effect="italics">not</em> the same thing as its molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_Egeom" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> describe all regions where electrons are located, bonds as well as lone pairs. Molecular structure describes the location of the <em data-effect="italics">atoms</em>, not the electrons.</p>
<p id="fs-idm334496">We differentiate between these two situations by naming the geometry that includes <em data-effect="italics">all</em> electron pairs the <span data-type="term">electron-pair geometry</span>. The structure that includes only the placement of the atoms in the molecule is called the <span data-type="term">molecular structure</span>. The electron-pair geometries will be the same as the molecular structures when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom, but they will be different when there are lone pairs present on the central atom.</p>
<p id="fs-idp48943296">For example, the methane molecule, CH<sub>4</sub>, which is the major component of natural gas, has four bonding pairs of electrons around the central carbon atom; the electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral, as is the molecular structure (<a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_CH4" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). On the other hand, the ammonia molecule, NH<sub>3</sub>, also has four electron pairs associated with the nitrogen atom, and thus has a tetrahedral electron-pair geometry. One of these regions, however, is a lone pair, which is not included in the molecular structure, and this lone pair influences the shape of the molecule (<a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_NH3" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idp38238416">As seen in <a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_NH3" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, small distortions from the ideal angles in <a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_Egeom" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> can result from differences in repulsion between various regions of electron density. VSEPR theory predicts these distortions by establishing an order of repulsions and an order of the amount of space occupied by different kinds of electron pairs. The order of electron-pair repulsions from greatest to least repulsion is:</p>

This molecule has regions of high electron density that consist of two single bonds and one double bond. The basic geometry is trigonal planar with 120&#176; bond angles, but we see that the double bond causes slightly larger angles (121&#176;), and the angle between the single bonds is slightly smaller (118&#176;).</p>
<p id="fs-idp125916256">In the ammonia molecule, the three hydrogen atoms attached to the central nitrogen are not arranged in a flat, trigonal planar molecular structure, but rather in a three-dimensional trigonal pyramid (<a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_NH3" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) with the nitrogen atom at the apex and the three hydrogen atoms forming the base. The ideal bond angles in a trigonal pyramid are based on the tetrahedral electron pair geometry. Again, there are slight deviations from the ideal because lone pairs occupy larger regions of space than do bonding electrons.

<p id="fs-idp3259504">According to VSEPR theory, the terminal atom locations (Xs in <a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) are equivalent within the linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral electron-pair geometries (the first three rows of the table). It does not matter which X is replaced with a lone pair because the molecules can be rotated to convert positions. For trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometries, however, there are two distinct X positions, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_Axeq" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>: an <span data-type="term">axial position</span> (if we hold a model of a trigonal bipyramid by the two axial positions, we have an axis around which we can rotate the model) and an <span data-type="term">equatorial position</span> (three positions form an equator around the middle of the molecule). As shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the axial position is surrounded by bond angles of 90&#176;, whereas the equatorial position has more space available because of the 120&#176; bond angles.

<p id="fs-idp147829184">The following procedure uses VSEPR theory to determine the electron pair geometries and the molecular structures:</p>
<ol id="fs-idp267826096" type="1">
<li>Write the Lewis structure of the molecule or polyatomic ion.</li>
<li>Count the number of regions of electron density (lone pairs and bonds) around the central atom. A single, double, or triple bond counts as one region of electron density.</li>
<li>Identify the electron-pair geometry based on the number of regions of electron density: linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, or octahedral (<a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, first column).</li>
<li>Use the number of lone pairs to determine the molecular structure (<a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). If more than one arrangement of lone pairs and chemical bonds is possible, choose the one that will minimize repulsions, remembering that lone pairs occupy more space than multiple bonds, which occupy more space than single bonds. In trigonal bipyramidal arrangements, repulsion is minimized when every lone pair is in an equatorial position. In an octahedral arrangement with two lone pairs, repulsion is minimized when the lone pairs are on opposite sides of the central atom.</li>

<p id="fs-idp78438784">When a molecule or polyatomic ion has only one central atom, the molecular structure completely describes the shape of the molecule. Larger molecules do not have a single central atom, but are connected by a chain of interior atoms that each possess a &#8220;local&#8221; geometry. The way these local structures are oriented with respect to each other also influences the molecular shape, but such considerations are largely beyond the scope of this introductory discussion.

<p id="fs-idp30351200">As discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing electronegativities, leaving one atom with a partial positive charge (&#948;+) and the other atom with a partial negative charge (&#948;&#8211;), as the electrons are pulled toward the more electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a <span data-type="term">bond dipole moment</span>. The magnitude of a bond dipole moment is represented by the Greek letter mu (<em data-effect="italics">&#181;</em>) and is given by the formula shown here, where Q is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined by the electronegativity difference) and r is the distance between the charges:</p>

<p id="fs-idp52773168">A whole molecule may also have a separation of charge, depending on its molecular structure and the polarity of each of its bonds. If such a charge separation exists, the molecule is said to be a <span data-type="term">polar molecule</span> (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to be nonpolar. The <span data-type="term">dipole moment</span> measures the extent of net charge separation in the molecule as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in three-dimensional space, taking into account the molecular structure.</p>
<p id="fs-idm10056464">For diatomic molecules, there is only one bond, so its bond dipole moment determines the molecular polarity. Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as Br<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment is zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF, there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in electronegativity.</p>
<p id="fs-idp218363312">When a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If the bonds in a molecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the situation in CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_CO2H2Odip" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule is linear with polar C=O bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water molecule (<a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_CO2H2Odip" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom, and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero bond moment. In this case, however, the molecular structure is bent because of the lone pairs on O, and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore, water does have a net dipole moment and is a polar molecule (dipole).</p>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_07_06_CO2H2Odip"><figcaption>The overall dipole moment of a molecule depends on the individual bond dipole moments and how they are arranged. (a) Each CO bond has a bond dipole moment, but they point in opposite directions so that the net CO<sub>2</sub> molecule is nonpolar.

This should display a molecule ABC with three electronegativity adjustors. You can display or hide the bond moments, molecular dipoles, and partial charges at the right. Turning on the Electric Field will show whether the molecule moves when exposed to a field, similar to <a href="#CNX_Chem_07_06_Dipolfield" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp12666320">VSEPR theory predicts the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule. It states that valence electrons will assume an electron-pair geometry that minimizes repulsions between areas of high electron density (bonds and/or lone pairs). Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the individual bond moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure. Polar molecules (those with an appreciable dipole moment) interact with electric fields, whereas nonpolar molecules do not.</p>
