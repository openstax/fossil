<p id="fs-id1532943">Bone tissue (osseous tissue) differs greatly from other tissues in the body. Bone is hard and many of its functions depend on that characteristic hardness. Later discussions in this chapter will show that bone is also dynamic in that its shape adjusts to accommodate stresses. This section will examine the gross anatomy of bone first and then move on to its histology.</p>

<p id="fs-id1025647">The structure of a long bone allows for the best visualization of all of the parts of a bone (<a href="#fig-ch06_03_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). A long bone has two parts: the <span data-type="term">diaphysis</span> and the <span data-type="term">epiphysis</span>. The diaphysis is the tubular shaft that runs between the proximal and distal ends of the bone. The hollow region in the diaphysis is called the <span data-type="term">medullary cavity</span>, which is filled with yellow marrow. The walls of the diaphysis are composed of dense and hard <span data-type="term">compact bone</span>.</p>

A blue articular cartilage covers the inner half of each bulge as well as the small trench that runs between the bulges. This area of the inferior end of the bone is labeled the distal epiphysis. Above the distal epiphysis is the metaphysis, where the bone tapers from the wide epiphysis into the relatively thin shaft. The entire length of the shaft is the diaphysis.

At the midpoint of the diaphysis, a nutrient artery travels through the periosteum and into the inner layers of the bone. The periosteum surrounds a white cylinder of solid bone labeled compact bone. The cavity at the center of the compact bone is called the medullary cavity. The inner layer of the compact bone that lines the medullary cavity is called the endosteum. Within the diaphysis, the medullary cavity contains a cylinder of yellow bone marrow that is penetrated by the nutrient artery. The superior end of the femur is also connected to the diaphysis by a metaphysis. In this upper metaphysis, the bone gradually widens between the diaphysis and the proximal epiphysis. The proximal epiphysis of the femur is roughly hexagonal in shape. However, the upper right side of the hexagon has a large, protruding knob.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1183302"><h3 data-type="title">Bone Markings</h3>
<p id="fs-id1239338">The surface features of bones vary considerably, depending on the function and location in the body. <a href="#tbl-ch06_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> describes the bone markings, which are illustrated in (<a href="#fig-ch06_03_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). There are three general classes of bone markings: (1) articulations, (2) projections, and (3) holes. As the name implies, an <span data-type="term">articulation</span> is where two bone surfaces come together (articulus = &#8220;joint&#8221;). These surfaces tend to conform to one another, such as one being rounded and the other cupped, to facilitate the function of the articulation. A <span data-type="term">projection</span> is an area of a bone that projects above the surface of the bone. These are the attachment points for tendons and ligaments. In general, their size and shape is an indication of the forces exerted through the attachment to the bone. A <span data-type="term">hole</span> is an opening or groove in the bone that allows blood vessels and nerves to enter the bone. As with the other markings, their size and shape reflect the size of the vessels and nerves that penetrate the bone at these points.</p><table class="top-titled" id="tbl-ch06_02" summary=""><thead>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1212775"><h3 data-type="title">Bone Cells and Tissue</h3>
<p id="fs-id1513558">Bone contains a relatively small number of cells entrenched in a matrix of collagen fibers that provide a surface for inorganic salt crystals to adhere. These salt crystals form when calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate combine to create hydroxyapatite, which incorporates other inorganic salts like magnesium hydroxide, fluoride, and sulfate as it crystallizes, or calcifies, on the collagen fibers. The hydroxyapatite crystals give bones their hardness and strength, while the collagen fibers give them flexibility so that they are not brittle.</p>
<p id="fs-id1524427">Although bone cells compose a small amount of the bone volume, they are crucial to the function of bones. Four types of cells are found within bone tissue: osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteogenic cells, and osteoclasts (<a href="#fig-ch06_03_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="fig-ch06_03_05"><div data-type="title">Bone Cells </div><figcaption>Four types of cells are found within bone tissue. Osteogenic cells are undifferentiated and develop into osteoblasts. When osteoblasts get trapped within the calcified matrix, their structure and function changes, and they become osteocytes.

</figure><p id="fs-id723536">The <span data-type="term">osteoblast</span> is the bone cell responsible for forming new bone and is found in the growing portions of bone, including the periosteum and endosteum. Osteoblasts, which do not divide, synthesize and secrete the collagen matrix and calcium salts. As the secreted matrix surrounding the osteoblast calcifies, the osteoblast become trapped within it; as a result, it changes in structure and becomes an <span data-type="term">osteocyte</span>, the primary cell of mature bone and the most common type of bone cell. Each osteocyte is located in a space called a <span data-type="term">lacuna</span> and is surrounded by bone tissue. Osteocytes maintain the mineral concentration of the matrix via the secretion of enzymes. Like osteoblasts, osteocytes lack mitotic activity. They can communicate with each other and receive nutrients via long cytoplasmic processes that extend through <span data-type="term">canaliculi</span> (singular = canaliculus), channels within the bone matrix.</p>
<p id="fs-id1468489">If osteoblasts and osteocytes are incapable of mitosis, then how are they replenished when old ones die? The answer lies in the properties of a third category of bone cells&#8212;the <span data-type="term">osteogenic cell</span>. These osteogenic cells are undifferentiated with high mitotic activity and they are the only bone cells that divide. Immature osteogenic cells are found in the deep layers of the periosteum and the marrow. They differentiate and develop into osteoblasts.</p>
<p id="fs-id1270226">The dynamic nature of bone means that new tissue is constantly formed, and old, injured, or unnecessary bone is dissolved for repair or for calcium release. The cell responsible for bone resorption, or breakdown, is the <span data-type="term">osteoclast</span>. They are found on bone surfaces, are multinucleated, and originate from monocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cells, not from osteogenic cells. Osteoclasts are continually breaking down old bone while osteoblasts are continually forming new bone.

Most bones contain compact and spongy osseous tissue, but their distribution and concentration vary based on the bone&#8217;s overall function. Compact bone is dense so that it can withstand compressive forces, while spongy (cancellous) bone has open spaces and supports shifts in weight distribution.</p>

<p id="fs-id1331361">Like compact bone, <span data-type="term">spongy bone</span>, also known as cancellous bone, contains osteocytes housed in lacunae, but they are not arranged in concentric circles.

The trabeculae may appear to be a random network, but each trabecula forms along lines of stress to provide strength to the bone. The spaces of the trabeculated network provide balance to the dense and heavy compact bone by making bones lighter so that muscles can move them more easily. In addition, the spaces in some spongy bones contain red marrow, protected by the trabeculae, where hematopoiesis occurs.</p>

<p id="fs-id1142742"><span data-type="title">Skeletal System: Paget&#8217;s Disease</span>
Paget&#8217;s disease usually occurs in adults over age 40. It is a disorder of the bone remodeling process that begins with overactive osteoclasts. This means more bone is resorbed than is laid down. The osteoblasts try to compensate but the new bone they lay down is weak and brittle and therefore prone to fracture.</p>
<p id="fs-id1241660">While some people with Paget&#8217;s disease have no symptoms, others experience pain, bone fractures, and bone deformities (<a href="#fig-ch06_03_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Bones of the pelvis, skull, spine, and legs are the most commonly affected. When occurring in the skull, Paget&#8217;s disease can cause headaches and hearing loss.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch06_03_08"><div data-type="title">Paget's Disease </div><figcaption>Normal leg bones are relatively straight, but those affected by Paget&#8217;s disease are porous and curved.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id1508032" data-alt="This illustration shows the normal skeletal structure of the legs from an anterior view.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id1435471">What causes the osteoclasts to become overactive? The answer is still unknown, but hereditary factors seem to play a role. Some scientists believe Paget&#8217;s disease is due to an as-yet-unidentified virus.</p>
<p id="fs-id1299241">Paget&#8217;s disease is diagnosed via imaging studies and lab tests. X-rays may show bone deformities or areas of bone resorption. Bone scans are also useful. In these studies, a dye containing a radioactive ion is injected into the body. Areas of bone resorption have an affinity for the ion, so they will light up on the scan if the ions are absorbed. In addition, blood levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase are typically elevated in people with Paget&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p id="fs-id1282000">Bisphosphonates, drugs that decrease the activity of osteoclasts, are often used in the treatment of Paget&#8217;s disease. However, in a small percentage of cases, bisphosphonates themselves have been linked to an increased risk of fractures because the old bone that is left after bisphosphonates are administered becomes worn out and brittle. Still, most doctors feel that the benefits of bisphosphonates more than outweigh the risk; the medical professional has to weigh the benefits and risks on a case-by-case basis. Bisphosphonate treatment can reduce the overall risk of deformities or fractures, which in turn reduces the risk of surgical repair and its associated risks and complications.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1318808"><h3 data-type="title">Blood and Nerve Supply</h3>
<p id="fs-id1147496">The spongy bone and medullary cavity receive nourishment from arteries that pass through the compact bone. The arteries enter through the <span data-type="term">nutrient foramen</span> (plural = foramina), small openings in the diaphysis (<a href="#fig-ch06_03_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The osteocytes in spongy bone are nourished by blood vessels of the periosteum that penetrate spongy bone and blood that circulates in the marrow cavities. As the blood passes through the marrow cavities, it is collected by veins, which then pass out of the bone through the foramina.</p>
<p id="fs-id1315185">In addition to the blood vessels, nerves follow the same paths into the bone where they tend to concentrate in the more metabolically active regions of the bone. The nerves sense pain, and it appears the nerves also play roles in regulating blood supplies and in bone growth, hence their concentrations in metabolically active sites of the bone.</p>

<p id="fs-id1075174">A hollow medullary cavity filled with yellow marrow runs the length of the diaphysis of a long bone. The walls of the diaphysis are compact bone. The epiphyses, which are wider sections at each end of a long bone, are filled with spongy bone and red marrow. The epiphyseal plate, a layer of hyaline cartilage, is replaced by osseous tissue as the organ grows in length. The medullary cavity has a delicate membranous lining called the endosteum. The outer surface of bone, except in regions covered with articular cartilage, is covered with a fibrous membrane called the periosteum. Flat bones consist of two layers of compact bone surrounding a layer of spongy bone. Bone markings depend on the function and location of bones. Articulations are places where two bones meet. Projections stick out from the surface of the bone and provide attachment points for tendons and ligaments. Holes are openings or depressions in the bones.</p>
<p id="fs-id1716294">Bone matrix consists of collagen fibers and organic ground substance, primarily hydroxyapatite formed from calcium salts. Osteogenic cells develop into osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are cells that make new bone. They become osteocytes, the cells of mature bone, when they get trapped in the matrix. Osteoclasts engage in bone resorption. Compact bone is dense and composed of osteons, while spongy bone is less dense and made up of trabeculae. Blood vessels and nerves enter the bone through the nutrient foramina to nourish and innervate bones.</p></section>
