<para id="fs-idp46142864">The nonmetals are elements located in the upper right portion of the periodic table. Their properties and behavior are quite different from those of metals on the left side. Under normal conditions, more than half of the nonmetals are gases, one is a liquid, and the rest include some of the softest and hardest of solids. The nonmetals exhibit a rich variety of chemical behaviors. They include the most reactive and least reactive of elements, and they form many different ionic and covalent compounds. This section presents an overview of the properties and chemical behaviors of the nonmetals, as well as the chemistry of specific elements. Many of these nonmetals are important in biological systems.</para>
<para id="fs-idp1055440">In many cases, trends in electronegativity enable us to predict the type of bonding and the physical states in compounds involving the nonmetals. We know that electronegativity decreases as we move down a given group and increases as we move from left to right across a period. The nonmetals have higher electronegativities than do metals, and compounds formed between metals and nonmetals are generally ionic in nature because of the large differences in electronegativity between them. The metals form cations, the nonmetals form anions, and the resulting compounds are solids under normal conditions. On the other hand, compounds formed between two or more nonmetals have small differences in electronegativity between the atoms, and covalent bonding—sharing of electrons—results. These substances tend to be molecular in nature and are gases, liquids, or volatile solids at room temperature and pressure.</para>
<para id="fs-idp14527328">In normal chemical processes, nonmetals do not form monatomic positive ions (cations) because their ionization energies are too high. All monatomic nonmetal ions are anions; examples include the chloride ion, Cl<sup>−</sup>, the nitride ion, N<sup>3−</sup>, and the selenide ion, Se<sup>2−</sup>.</para>
<para id="fs-idm155738224">The common oxidation states that the nonmetals exhibit in their ionic and covalent compounds are shown in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_18_04_OxStNonmts"/>. Remember that an element exhibits a positive oxidation state when combined with a more electronegative element and that it exhibits a negative oxidation state when combined with a less electronegative element.</para>

<media id="fs-idp165773088" alt="Six columns of information are shown. The first column has three pieces of data: “H,” “1 positive sign,” and “1 negative sign.” The second column has four pieces of data: “C,” “4 positive sign,” the word, “To,” and, “4 negative sign.” The third column has eight pieces of data: “N,” “5 positive sign,” the word, “To,” “3 negative sign,” “P, A s,” “5 positive sign,” “3 positive sign,” and “3 negative sign.” The fourth column has seven pieces of data: “O,” “1 negative sign,” “2 negative sign,” “S, S e,” “6 positive sign,” “4 positive sign,” and “2 negative sign.” The fifth column has eight pieces of data: “F,” “1 negative sign,” “C l, B r, I,” “7 positive sign,” “5 positive sign,” “3 positive sign,” “1 positive sign,” and “1 negative sign.” The sixth column has five pieces of data: “X e,” “8 positive sign,” “6 positive sign,” “4 positive sign,” and “2 positive sign.”">

<para id="fs-idm146473008">The first member of each nonmetal group exhibits different behaviors, in many respects, from the other group members. The reasons for this include smaller size, greater ionization energy, and (most important) the fact that the first member of each group has only four valence orbitals (one 2<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> and three 2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>) available for bonding, whereas other group members have empty <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis> orbitals in their valence shells, making possible five, six, or even more bonds around the central atom. For example, nitrogen forms only NF<sub>3,</sub> whereas phosphorus forms both PF<sub>3</sub> and PF<sub>5</sub>.</para>
<para id="fs-idm105671392">Another difference between the first group member and subsequent members is the greater ability of the first member to form <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> bonds. This is primarily a function of the smaller size of the first member of each group, which allows better overlap of atomic orbitals. Nonmetals, other than the first member of each group, rarely form π bonds to nonmetals that are the first member of a group. For example, sulfur-oxygen π bonds are well known, whereas sulfur does not normally form stable π bonds to itself.</para>
<para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="fs-idm175306688">The variety of oxidation states displayed by most of the nonmetals means that many of their chemical reactions involve changes in oxidation state through oxidation-reduction reactions.

The other halogens are also diatomic; Br<sub>2</sub> is a liquid and I<sub>2</sub> exists as a solid under normal conditions.

<para id="fs-idp56198176">Atoms within a graphite layer are bonded together tightly by the σ and π bonds; however, the forces between layers are weak. London dispersion forces hold the layers together. To learn more, see the discussion of these weak forces in the chapter on liquids and solids. The weak forces between layers give graphite the soft, flaky character that makes it useful as the so-called “lead” in pencils and the slippery character that makes it useful as a lubricant. The loosely held electrons in the resonating π bonds can move throughout the solid and are responsible for the electrical conductivity of graphite.</para>

<title>Phosphorus</title>
<para id="fs-idm188499280">The name <emphasis effect="italics">phosphorus</emphasis> comes from the Greek words meaning <emphasis effect="italics">light bringing.</emphasis> When phosphorus was first isolated, scientists noted that it glowed in the dark and burned when exposed to air. Phosphorus is the only member of its group that does not occur in the uncombined state in nature; it exists in many allotropic forms. We will consider two of those forms: white phosphorus and red phosphorus.</para>
<para id="fs-idm197336480">White phosphorus is a white, waxy solid that melts at 44.2 °C and boils at 280 °C. It is insoluble in water (in which it is stored—see <link target-id="CNX_Chem_18_04_Phosphorus"/>), is very soluble in carbon disulfide, and bursts into flame in air. As a solid, as a liquid, as a gas, and in solution, white phosphorus exists as P<sub>4</sub> molecules with four phosphorus atoms at the corners of a regular tetrahedron, as illustrated in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_18_04_Phosphorus"/>. Each phosphorus atom covalently bonds to the other three atoms in the molecule by single covalent bonds. White phosphorus is the most reactive allotrope and is very toxic.</para>

Red phosphorus is insoluble in solvents that dissolve white phosphorus. When red phosphorus is heated, P<sub>4</sub> molecules sublime from the solid.</para></section>

<title>Sulfur</title>
<para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="fs-idm76786544">The allotropy of sulfur is far greater and more complex than that of any other element. Sulfur is the brimstone referred to in the Bible and other places, and references to sulfur occur throughout recorded history—right up to the relatively recent discovery that it is a component of the atmospheres of Venus and of Io, a moon of Jupiter. The most common and most stable allotrope of sulfur is yellow, rhombic sulfur, so named because of the shape of its crystals. Rhombic sulfur is the form to which all other allotropes revert at room temperature. Crystals of rhombic sulfur melt at 113 °C. Cooling this liquid gives long needles of monoclinic sulfur. This form is stable from 96 °C to the melting point, 119 °C. At room temperature, it gradually reverts to the rhombic form.</para><para id="fs-idm187719200">Both rhombic sulfur and monoclinic sulfur contain S<sub>8</sub> molecules in which atoms form eight-membered, puckered rings that resemble crowns, as illustrated in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_18_04_Sulfrchain"/>. Each sulfur atom is bonded to each of its two neighbors in the ring by covalent S-S single bonds.</para>

Here are (a) individual S<sub>8</sub> rings, (b) S<sub>8</sub> chains formed when the rings open, (c) longer chains formed by adding sulfur atoms to S<sub>8</sub> chains, and (d) part of the very long sulfur chains formed at higher temperatures.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm163997136">When rhombic sulfur melts, the straw-colored liquid is quite mobile; its viscosity is low because S<sub>8</sub> molecules are essentially spherical and offer relatively little resistance as they move past each other. As the temperature rises, S-S bonds in the rings break, and polymeric chains of sulfur atoms result. These chains combine end to end, forming still longer chains that tangle with one another. The liquid gradually darkens in color and becomes so viscous that finally (at about 230 °C) it does not pour easily. The dangling atoms at the ends of the chains of sulfur atoms are responsible for the dark red color because their electronic structure differs from those of sulfur atoms that have bonds to two adjacent sulfur atoms. This causes them to absorb light differently and results in a different visible color. Cooling the liquid rapidly produces a rubberlike amorphous mass, called plastic sulfur.</para>
<para id="fs-idm133348256">Sulfur boils at 445 °C and forms a vapor consisting of S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>6</sub>, and S<sub>8</sub> molecules; at about 1000 °C, the vapor density corresponds to the formula S<sub>2</sub>, which is a paramagnetic molecule like O<sub>2</sub> with a similar electronic structure and a weak sulfur-sulfur double bond.</para>
<para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="fs-idm1928176">As seen in this discussion, an important feature of the structural behavior of the nonmetals is that the elements usually occur with eight electrons in their valence shells. If necessary, the elements form enough covalent bonds to supplement the electrons already present to possess an octet. For example, members of group 15 have five valence electrons and require only three additional electrons to fill their valence shells. These elements form three covalent bonds in their free state: triple bonds in the N<sub>2</sub> molecule or single bonds to three different atoms in arsenic and phosphorus. The elements of group 16 require only two additional electrons. Oxygen forms a double bond in the O<sub>2</sub> molecule, and sulfur, selenium, and tellurium form two single bonds in various rings and chains. The halogens form diatomic molecules in which each atom is involved in only one bond. This provides the electron required necessary to complete the octet on the halogen atom. The noble gases do not form covalent bonds to other noble gas atoms because they already have a filled outer shell.</para></section>
