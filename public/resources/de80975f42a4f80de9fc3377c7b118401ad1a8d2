<para id="fs-idp22389648">The earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers, the scientists of their day. In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was composed of small, finite particles that they called <emphasis effect="italics">atomos</emphasis>, a term derived from the Greek word for “indivisible.” They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later, Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four “elements”—fire, earth, air, and water—and could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and “elements” as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas.</para>
<para id="fs-idp136823072">The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic theory. First published in 1807, many of Dalton’s hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern atomic theory. Here are the postulates of <term>Dalton’s atomic theory</term>.</para>
<list id="fs-idp28280144" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
<item>Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles called atoms. An <term class="no-emphasis">atom</term> is the smallest unit of an element that can participate in a chemical change.</item>

<para id="fs-idp64032864">Dalton’s atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter that you’ve learned about. For example, if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom, then it cannot be broken down into simpler substances, that is, into substances composed of fewer types of atoms. And if atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, then the total mass of matter present when matter changes from one type to another will remain constant (the law of conservation of matter).</para>

<title>Testing Dalton’s Atomic Theory</title>
In the following drawing, the green spheres represent atoms of a certain element. The purple spheres represent atoms of another element.

</example>
<para id="fs-idp28034944">Dalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that <emphasis effect="italics">all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass</emphasis>. This statement is known as the <term>law of definite proportions</term> or the <term>law of constant composition</term>. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in <link target-id="fs-idp114534448"/>.</para>

Sample A contains 14.82 grams of carbon and 2.78 grams of hydrogen. Its mass ratio is, therefore, 14.82 grams of carbon over 2.78 grams of hydrogen. This ratio is equal to 5.33 grams of carbon over 1.00 gram of hydrogen. Sample B contains 22.33 grams of carbon and 4.19 grams of hydrogen. Its mass ratio is 22.3 grams of carbon over 4.19 grams of hydrogen which is equal to 5.33 grams of carbon over 1.00 gram of hydrogen. Sample C contains 19.40 grams of carbon and 3.64 grams of hydrogen.

<para id="fs-idp149501712">It is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.</para>
<para id="fs-idp113358288">Dalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The <term>law of multiple proportions</term> states that <emphasis effect="italics">when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole numbers</emphasis>. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.</para>

<para id="fs-idm8092064">The ancient Greeks proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms. Dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. Samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. When two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio.
