<p id="fs-id2363815">Before you begin to study the different structures and functions of the human body, it is helpful to consider its basic architecture; that is, how its smallest parts are assembled into larger structures. It is convenient to consider the structures of the body in terms of  fundamental levels of organization that increase in complexity: subatomic particles, atoms, molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms and biosphere (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p><figure id="fig-ch01_02_01"><div data-type="title">Levels of Structural Organization of the Human Body</div><figcaption>The organization of the body often is discussed in terms of six distinct levels of increasing complexity, from the smallest chemical building blocks to a unique human organism.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id1371068" data-alt="This illustration shows biological organization as a pyramid. The chemical level is at the apex of the pyramid where atoms bond to form molecules with three dimensional structures. An example is shown with two white hydrogen atoms bonding to a red oxygen atom to create water. The next level down on the pyramid is the cellular level, as illustrated with a long, tapered, smooth muscle cell. At this level, a variety of molecules combine to form the interior fluid and organelles of a body cell. The next level down is the tissue level. A community of similar cells forms body tissue. The example given here is a section of smooth muscle tissue, which contains many smooth muscle cells closely bound side by side. The next level down is the organ level, as illustrated with the bladder and urethra. The bladder contains smooth muscle while the urethra contains skeletal muscle. These are both examples of muscle tissues. The next level down is the organ system level, as illustrated by the entire urinary system containing the kidney, ureters, bladder and urethra. At this level, two or more organs work closely together to perform the functions of a body system. At the base of the pyramid is the organismal level illustrated with a woman drinking water. At this level, many organ systems work harmoniously together to perform the functions of an independent organism.">

All matter in the universe is composed of one or more unique pure substances called elements, familiar examples of which are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, and iron. The smallest unit of any of these pure substances (elements) is an atom. Atoms are made up of subatomic particles such as the proton, electron and neutron. Two or more atoms combine to form a molecule, such as the water molecules, proteins, and sugars found in living things. Molecules are the chemical building blocks of all body structures.</p><p id="fs-id2348119">A <span data-type="term">cell</span> is the smallest independently functioning unit of a living organism. Even bacteria, which are extremely small, independently-living organisms, have a cellular structure. Each bacterium is a single cell. All living structures of human anatomy contain cells, and almost all functions of human physiology are performed in cells or are initiated by cells.</p>
<p id="fs-id1641187">A human cell typically consists of flexible membranes that enclose cytoplasm, a water-based cellular fluid together with a variety of tiny functioning units called <span data-type="term">organelles</span>. In humans, as in all organisms, cells perform all functions of life. A <span data-type="term">tissue</span> is a group of many similar cells (though sometimes composed of a few related types) that work together to perform a specific function. An <span data-type="term">organ</span> is an anatomically distinct structure of the body composed of two or more tissue types. Each organ performs one or more specific physiological functions. An <span data-type="term">organ system</span> is a group of organs that work together to perform major functions or meet physiological needs of the body.</p><p id="fs-id2292264">This book covers eleven distinct organ systems in the human body (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#fig-ch01_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Assigning organs to organ systems can be imprecise since organs that &#8220;belong&#8221; to one system can also have functions integral to another system. In fact, most organs contribute to more than one system.</p>

These include the chemical, cellular, tissue, organ, organ system, and the organism level. Higher levels of organization are built from lower levels. Therefore, molecules combine to form cells, cells combine to form tissues, tissues combine to form organs, organs combine to form organ systems, and organ systems combine to form organisms.</p>
