<p id="fs-id1859022">A <span data-type="term">fracture</span> is a broken bone. It will heal whether or not a physician resets it in its anatomical position. If the bone is not reset correctly, the healing process will keep the bone in its deformed position.</p>
<p id="fs-id1236995">When a broken bone is manipulated and set into its natural position without surgery, the procedure is called a <span data-type="term">closed reduction</span>. <span data-type="term">Open reduction</span> requires surgery to expose the fracture and reset the bone. While some fractures can be minor, others are quite severe and result in grave complications. For example, a fractured diaphysis of the femur has the potential to release fat globules into the bloodstream. These can become lodged in the capillary beds of the lungs, leading to respiratory distress and if not treated quickly, death.</p>

In an impacted fracture, the crack zig zags throughout the width of the bone like a lightning bolt.

<p id="fs-id691880">When a bone breaks, blood flows from any vessel torn by the fracture. These vessels could be in the periosteum, osteons, and/or medullary cavity. The blood begins to clot, and about six to eight hours after the fracture, the clotting blood has formed a <span data-type="term">fracture hematoma</span> (<a href="#fig-ch06_05_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">a</strong>). The disruption of blood flow to the bone results in the death of bone cells around the fracture.</p>

The break is shown in the leftmost image, where the femur has an oblique, closed fracture in the middle of its shaft.

Within the internal callus, the blood vessels have reconnected and some spongy bone has regenerated in the gap between the two bone halves. In the next image, spongy bone has completely regenerated, connecting the two broken ends, referred to as the bony callus. The external callus still remains on the lateral and medial sides of the break, as the compact bone has not yet regenerated.

</figure><p id="fs-id1738761">Within about 48 hours after the fracture, chondrocytes from the endosteum have created an <span data-type="term">internal callus</span> (plural = calli) by secreting a fibrocartilaginous matrix between the two ends of the broken bone, while the periosteal chondrocytes and osteoblasts create an <span data-type="term">external callus</span> of hyaline cartilage and bone, respectively, around the outside of the break  (<a href="#fig-ch06_05_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">b</strong>).

<p id="fs-id1804989">Over the next several weeks, osteoclasts resorb the dead bone; osteogenic cells become active, divide, and differentiate into osteoblasts.

<p id="fs-id1594571">Eventually, the internal and external calli unite, compact bone replaces spongy bone at the outer margins of the fracture, and healing is complete.

<p id="fs-id1692399">Fractured bones may be repaired by closed reduction or open reduction. Fractures are classified by their complexity, location, and other features. Common types of fractures are transverse, oblique, spiral, comminuted, impacted, greenstick, open (or compound), and closed (or simple). Healing of fractures begins with the formation of a hematoma, followed by internal and external calli. Osteoclasts resorb dead bone, while osteoblasts create new bone that replaces the cartilage in the calli. The calli eventually unite, remodeling occurs, and healing is complete.</p></section>
