<p id="fs-id1435343">The term <span data-type="term">tissue</span> is used to describe a group of cells found together in the body. The cells within a tissue share a common embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features and are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue&#8217;s functions. From the evolutionary perspective, tissues appear in more complex organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have cells organized into tissues.</p>
<p id="fs-id1524079">Although there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that contribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or disease. Such changes can be detected through <span data-type="term">histology</span>, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization, and function.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1515327"><h3 data-type="title">The Four Types of Tissues</h3>
<p id="fs-id1312224"><span data-type="term">Epithelial tissue</span>, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body, lines internal cavities and passageways, and forms certain glands. <span data-type="term">Connective tissue</span>, as its name implies, binds the cells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the body. <span data-type="term">Muscle tissue</span> is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as three major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. <span data-type="term">Nervous tissue</span> is also excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate between different regions of the body (<a href="#fig-ch04_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<p id="fs-id1495202">The next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just as knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you understand how organs function. The epithelial and connective tissues are discussed in detail in this chapter. Muscle and nervous tissues will be discussed only briefly in this chapter.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1461653"><h3 data-type="title">Embryonic Origin of Tissues</h3><p id="fs-id1534105">The zygote, or fertilized egg, is a single cell formed by the fusion of an egg and sperm. After fertilization the zygote gives rise to rapid mitotic cycles, generating many cells to form the embryo. The first embryonic cells generated have the ability to differentiate into any type of cell in the body and, as such, are called <span data-type="term">totipotent</span>, meaning each has the capacity to divide, differentiate, and develop into a new organism. As cell proliferation progresses, three major cell lineages are established within the embryo. As explained in a later chapter, each of these lineages of embryonic cells forms the distinct germ layers from which all the tissues and organs of the human body eventually form. Each germ layer is identified by its relative position: <span data-type="term">ectoderm</span> (ecto- = &#8220;outer&#8221;), <span data-type="term">mesoderm</span> (meso- = &#8220;middle&#8221;), and <span data-type="term">endoderm</span> (endo- = &#8220;inner&#8221;). <a href="#fig-ch04_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the types of tissues and organs associated with the each of the three germ layers.

<p id="fs-id1102328">The <span data-type="term">connective tissue membrane</span> is formed solely from connective tissue. These membranes encapsulate organs, such as the kidneys, and line our movable joints. A <span data-type="term">synovial membrane</span> is a type of connective tissue membrane that lines the cavity of a freely movable joint. For example, synovial membranes surround the joints of the shoulder, elbow, and knee. Fibroblasts in the inner layer of the synovial membrane release hyaluronan into the joint cavity. The hyaluronan effectively traps available water to form the synovial fluid, a natural lubricant that enables the bones of a joint to move freely against one another without much friction. This synovial fluid readily exchanges water and nutrients with blood, as do all body fluids.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1514999"><h4 data-type="title">Epithelial Membranes</h4>
<p id="fs-id1522633">The <span data-type="term">epithelial membrane</span> is composed of epithelium attached to a layer of connective tissue, for example, your skin. The <span data-type="term">mucous membrane</span> is also a composite of connective and epithelial tissues. Sometimes called mucosae, these epithelial membranes line the body cavities and hollow passageways that open to the external environment, and include the digestive, respiratory, excretory, and reproductive tracts. Mucous, produced by the epithelial exocrine glands, covers the epithelial layer. The underlying connective tissue, called the <span data-type="term">lamina propria</span> (literally &#8220;own layer&#8221;), help support the fragile epithelial layer.</p>
<p id="fs-id1110348">A <span data-type="term">serous membrane</span> is an epithelial membrane composed of mesodermally derived epithelium called the mesothelium that is supported by connective tissue. These membranes line the coelomic cavities of the body, that is, those cavities that do not open to the outside, and they cover the organs located within those cavities. They are essentially membranous bags, with mesothelium lining the inside and connective tissue on the outside. Serous fluid secreted by the cells of the thin squamous mesothelium lubricates the membrane and reduces abrasion and friction between organs. Serous membranes are identified according locations. Three serous membranes line the thoracic cavity; the two pleura that cover the lungs and the pericardium that covers the heart. A fourth, the peritoneum, is the serous membrane in the abdominal cavity that covers abdominal organs and forms double sheets of mesenteries that suspend many of the digestive organs.</p>
<p id="fs-id1432081">The skin is an epithelial membrane also called the <span data-type="term">cutaneous membrane</span>. It is a stratified squamous epithelial membrane resting on top of connective tissue. The apical surface of this membrane is exposed to the external environment and is covered with dead, keratinized cells that help protect the body from desiccation and pathogens.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1515834" class="summary"><h3 data-type="title">Chapter Review</h3>
<p id="fs-id1466200">The human body contains more than 200 types of cells that can all be classified into four types of tissues: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial tissues act as coverings controlling the movement of materials across the surface. Connective tissue integrates the various parts of the body and provides support and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows the body to move. Nervous tissues propagate information.</p>
<p id="fs-id1315197">The study of the shape and arrangement of cells in tissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the body derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.</p>
<p id="fs-id1462627">Different types of tissues form membranes that enclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction between organs, and keep organs together. Synovial membranes are connective tissue membranes that protect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are formed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of connective tissue. There are three types of epithelial membranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous, which secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the skin.</p>

<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1404264" data-label="">
<p id="fs-id197598">The four types of tissue in the body are epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial tissue is made of layers of cells that cover the surfaces of the body that come into contact with the exterior world, line internal cavities, and form glands. Connective tissue binds the cells and organs of the body together and performs many functions, especially in the protection, support, and integration of the body. Muscle tissue, which responds to stimulation and contracts to provide movement, is divided into three major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscles, smooth muscles, and the cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue allows the body to receive signals and transmit information as electric impulses from one region of the body to another.</p>

<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1164738" data-label="">
<p id="fs-id969372">The zygote divides into many cells. As these cells become specialized, they lose their ability to differentiate into all tissues. At first they form the three primary germ layers. Following the cells of the ectodermal germ layer, they too become more restricted in what they can form. Ultimately, some of these ectodermal cells become further restricted and differentiate in to nerve cells.</p>
