<p id="fs-idp46142864">The nonmetals are elements located in the upper right portion of the periodic table. Their properties and behavior are quite different from those of metals on the left side. Under normal conditions, more than half of the nonmetals are gases, one is a liquid, and the rest include some of the softest and hardest of solids. The nonmetals exhibit a rich variety of chemical behaviors. They include the most reactive and least reactive of elements, and they form many different ionic and covalent compounds. This section presents an overview of the properties and chemical behaviors of the nonmetals, as well as the chemistry of specific elements. Many of these nonmetals are important in biological systems.</p>
<p id="fs-idp1055440">In many cases, trends in electronegativity enable us to predict the type of bonding and the physical states in compounds involving the nonmetals. We know that electronegativity decreases as we move down a given group and increases as we move from left to right across a period. The nonmetals have higher electronegativities than do metals, and compounds formed between metals and nonmetals are generally ionic in nature because of the large differences in electronegativity between them. The metals form cations, the nonmetals form anions, and the resulting compounds are solids under normal conditions. On the other hand, compounds formed between two or more nonmetals have small differences in electronegativity between the atoms, and covalent bonding&#8212;sharing of electrons&#8212;results. These substances tend to be molecular in nature and are gases, liquids, or volatile solids at room temperature and pressure.</p>
<p id="fs-idp14527328">In normal chemical processes, nonmetals do not form monatomic positive ions (cations) because their ionization energies are too high. All monatomic nonmetal ions are anions; examples include the chloride ion, Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>, the nitride ion, N<sup>3&#8722;</sup>, and the selenide ion, Se<sup>2&#8722;</sup>.</p>
<p id="fs-idm155738224">The common oxidation states that the nonmetals exhibit in their ionic and covalent compounds are shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_18_04_OxStNonmts" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Remember that an element exhibits a positive oxidation state when combined with a more electronegative element and that it exhibits a negative oxidation state when combined with a less electronegative element.</p>

<p id="fs-idm146473008">The first member of each nonmetal group exhibits different behaviors, in many respects, from the other group members. The reasons for this include smaller size, greater ionization energy, and (most important) the fact that the first member of each group has only four valence orbitals (one 2<em data-effect="italics">s</em> and three 2<em data-effect="italics">p</em>) available for bonding, whereas other group members have empty <em data-effect="italics">d</em> orbitals in their valence shells, making possible five, six, or even more bonds around the central atom. For example, nitrogen forms only NF<sub>3,</sub> whereas phosphorus forms both PF<sub>3</sub> and PF<sub>5</sub>.</p>
<p id="fs-idm105671392">Another difference between the first group member and subsequent members is the greater ability of the first member to form <em data-effect="italics">&#960;</em> bonds. This is primarily a function of the smaller size of the first member of each group, which allows better overlap of atomic orbitals. Nonmetals, other than the first member of each group, rarely form &#960; bonds to nonmetals that are the first member of a group. For example, sulfur-oxygen &#960; bonds are well known, whereas sulfur does not normally form stable &#960; bonds to itself.</p>
<p id="fs-idm175306688">The variety of oxidation states displayed by most of the nonmetals means that many of their chemical reactions involve changes in oxidation state through oxidation-reduction reactions. There are five general aspects of the oxidation-reduction chemistry:</p><ol id="fs-idm145782848" type="1">
<li>Nonmetals oxidize most metals. The oxidation state of the metal becomes positive as it undergoes oxidation and that of the nonmetal becomes negative as it undergoes reduction. For example:<span data-type="newline"><br/></span>

<p id="fs-idm217428112">The binary hydrogen compounds of the nonmetals also exhibit an acidic behavior in water, although only HCl, HBr, and HI are strong acids. The acid strength of the nonmetal hydrogen compounds increases from left to right across a period and down a group. For example, ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, is a weaker acid than is water, H<sub>2</sub>O, which is weaker than is hydrogen fluoride, HF. Water, H<sub>2</sub>O, is also a weaker acid than is hydrogen sulfide, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>,</sub> which is weaker than is hydrogen selenide, H<sub>2</sub>Se.

<p id="fs-idm97847936">The structures of the nonmetals differ dramatically from those of metals. Metals crystallize in closely packed arrays that do not contain molecules or covalent bonds. Nonmetal structures contain covalent bonds, and many nonmetals consist of individual molecules. The electrons in nonmetals are localized in covalent bonds, whereas in a metal, there is delocalization of the electrons throughout the solid.</p>
<p id="fs-idm97451120">The noble gases are all monatomic, whereas the other nonmetal gases&#8212;hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine&#8212;normally exist as the diatomic molecules H<sub>2,</sub> N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, and Cl<sub>2</sub>. The other halogens are also diatomic; Br<sub>2</sub> is a liquid and I<sub>2</sub> exists as a solid under normal conditions. The changes in state as one moves down the halogen family offer excellent examples of the increasing strength of intermolecular London forces with increasing molecular mass and increasing polarizability.</p>
<p id="fs-idm108747680">Oxygen has two allotropes: O<sub>2</sub>, dioxygen, and O<sub>3</sub>, ozone. Phosphorus has three common allotropes, commonly referred to by their colors: white, red, and black. Sulfur has several allotropes. There are also many carbon allotropes. Most people know of diamond, graphite, and charcoal, but fewer people know of the recent discovery of fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene.</p>

<p id="fs-idp56198176">Atoms within a graphite layer are bonded together tightly by the &#963; and &#960; bonds; however, the forces between layers are weak.

The weak forces between layers give graphite the soft, flaky character that makes it useful as the so-called &#8220;lead&#8221; in pencils and the slippery character that makes it useful as a lubricant.

<p id="fs-idm143379488">Graphene is a very strong, lightweight, and efficient conductor of heat and electricity discovered in 2003. As in graphite, the carbon atoms form a layer of six-membered rings with <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon atoms at the corners. Resonance stabilizes the system and leads to its conductivity. Unlike graphite, there is no stacking of the layers to give a three-dimensional structure. Andre <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Geim</span> and Kostya <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Novoselov</span> at the University of Manchester won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering work characterizing graphene.</p>
<p id="fs-idm162489136">The simplest procedure for preparing graphene is to use a piece of adhesive tape to remove a single layer of graphene from the surface of a piece of graphite. This method works because there are only weak London dispersion forces between the layers in graphite. Alternative methods are to deposit a single layer of carbon atoms on the surface of some other material (ruthenium, iridium, or copper) or to synthesize it at the surface of silicon carbide via the sublimation of silicon.</p>
<p id="fs-idm221903792">There currently are no commercial applications of graphene. However, its unusual properties, such as high electron mobility and thermal conductivity, should make it suitable for the manufacture of many advanced electronic devices and for thermal management applications.</p>

<p id="fs-idm217457872">Carbon nanotubes are extremely strong materials that are harder than diamond. Depending upon the shape of the nanotube, it may be a conductor or semiconductor. For some applications, the conducting form is preferable, whereas other applications utilize the semiconducting form.</p>
<p id="fs-idm97062944">The basis for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes is the generation of carbon atoms in a vacuum. It is possible to produce carbon atoms by an electrical discharge through graphite, vaporization of graphite with a laser, and the decomposition of a carbon compound.</p>
<p id="fs-idp36666976">The strength of carbon nanotubes will eventually lead to some of their most exciting applications, as a thread produced from several nanotubes will support enormous weight. However, the current applications only employ bulk nanotubes. The addition of nanotubes to polymers improves the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the bulk material. There are currently nanotubes in some bicycle parts, skis, baseball bats, fishing rods, and surfboards.</p>

<p id="fs-idm188499280">The name <em data-effect="italics">phosphorus</em> comes from the Greek words meaning <em data-effect="italics">light bringing.</em> When phosphorus was first isolated, scientists noted that it glowed in the dark and burned when exposed to air. Phosphorus is the only member of its group that does not occur in the uncombined state in nature; it exists in many allotropic forms. We will consider two of those forms: white phosphorus and red phosphorus.</p>
<p id="fs-idm197336480">White phosphorus is a white, waxy solid that melts at 44.2 &#176;C and boils at 280 &#176;C. It is insoluble in water (in which it is stored&#8212;see <a href="#CNX_Chem_18_04_Phosphorus" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), is very soluble in carbon disulfide, and bursts into flame in air. As a solid, as a liquid, as a gas, and in solution, white phosphorus exists as P<sub>4</sub> molecules with four phosphorus atoms at the corners of a regular tetrahedron, as illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Chem_18_04_Phosphorus" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Each phosphorus atom covalently bonds to the other three atoms in the molecule by single covalent bonds. White phosphorus is the most reactive allotrope and is very toxic.</p>

<p id="fs-idm76786544">The allotropy of sulfur is far greater and more complex than that of any other element. Sulfur is the brimstone referred to in the Bible and other places, and references to sulfur occur throughout recorded history&#8212;right up to the relatively recent discovery that it is a component of the atmospheres of Venus and of Io, a moon of Jupiter. The most common and most stable allotrope of sulfur is yellow, rhombic sulfur, so named because of the shape of its crystals. Rhombic sulfur is the form to which all other allotropes revert at room temperature. Crystals of rhombic sulfur melt at 113 &#176;C. Cooling this liquid gives long needles of monoclinic sulfur. This form is stable from 96 &#176;C to the melting point, 119 &#176;C. At room temperature, it gradually reverts to the rhombic form.</p><p id="fs-idm187719200">Both rhombic sulfur and monoclinic sulfur contain S<sub>8</sub> molecules in which atoms form eight-membered, puckered rings that resemble crowns, as illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Chem_18_04_Sulfrchain" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.

<p id="fs-idm163997136">When rhombic sulfur melts, the straw-colored liquid is quite mobile; its viscosity is low because S<sub>8</sub> molecules are essentially spherical and offer relatively little resistance as they move past each other. As the temperature rises, S-S bonds in the rings break, and polymeric chains of sulfur atoms result. These chains combine end to end, forming still longer chains that tangle with one another. The liquid gradually darkens in color and becomes so viscous that finally (at about 230 &#176;C) it does not pour easily. The dangling atoms at the ends of the chains of sulfur atoms are responsible for the dark red color because their electronic structure differs from those of sulfur atoms that have bonds to two adjacent sulfur atoms. This causes them to absorb light differently and results in a different visible color. Cooling the liquid rapidly produces a rubberlike amorphous mass, called plastic sulfur.</p>
<p id="fs-idm133348256">Sulfur boils at 445 &#176;C and forms a vapor consisting of S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>6</sub>, and S<sub>8</sub> molecules; at about 1000 &#176;C, the vapor density corresponds to the formula S<sub>2</sub>, which is a paramagnetic molecule like O<sub>2</sub> with a similar electronic structure and a weak sulfur-sulfur double bond.</p>
<p id="fs-idm1928176">As seen in this discussion, an important feature of the structural behavior of the nonmetals is that the elements usually occur with eight electrons in their valence shells. If necessary, the elements form enough covalent bonds to supplement the electrons already present to possess an octet. For example, members of group 15 have five valence electrons and require only three additional electrons to fill their valence shells. These elements form three covalent bonds in their free state: triple bonds in the N<sub>2</sub> molecule or single bonds to three different atoms in arsenic and phosphorus. The elements of group 16 require only two additional electrons. Oxygen forms a double bond in the O<sub>2</sub> molecule, and sulfur, selenium, and tellurium form two single bonds in various rings and chains. The halogens form diatomic molecules in which each atom is involved in only one bond. This provides the electron required necessary to complete the octet on the halogen atom. The noble gases do not form covalent bonds to other noble gas atoms because they already have a filled outer shell.</p></section>

<div data-type="solution" id="fs-idm107239040">
<p id="fs-idm306366400">In the N<sub>2</sub> molecule, the nitrogen atoms have an &#963; bond and two &#960; bonds holding the two atoms together. The presence of three strong bonds makes N<sub>2</sub> a very stable molecule. Phosphorus is a third-period element, and as such, does not form &#960; bonds efficiently; therefore, it must fulfill its bonding requirement by forming three &#963; bonds.</p>
