<para id="fs-idm38786224">Thus far in this chapter, we have discussed the various types of bonds that form between atoms and/or ions. In all cases, these bonds involve the sharing or transfer of valence shell electrons between atoms.

<title>Lewis Structures</title>
<para id="fs-idp28276192">We also use Lewis symbols to indicate the formation of covalent bonds, which are shown in <term>Lewis structures</term>, drawings that describe the bonding in molecules and polyatomic ions. For example, when two chlorine atoms form a chlorine molecule, they share one pair of electrons:</para>

<para id="fs-idm75288528">The Lewis structure indicates that each Cl atom has three pairs of electrons that are not used in bonding (called <term>lone pairs</term>) and one shared pair of electrons (written between the atoms).

<section id="fs-idp113967376">
<title>The Octet Rule</title>
<para id="fs-idm16266560">The other halogen molecules (F<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, and At<sub>2</sub>) form bonds like those in the chlorine molecule: one single bond between atoms and three lone pairs of electrons per atom. This allows each halogen atom to have a noble gas electron configuration. The tendency of main group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons is known as the <term>octet rule</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-idm45369344">The number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table (C, N, O, and F). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as illustrated here for carbon in CCl<sub>4</sub> (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon in SiH<sub>4</sub> (silane). Because hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, it is an exception to the octet rule. The transition elements and inner transition elements also do not follow the octet rule:</para>
<media id="fs-idm75466464" alt="Two sets of Lewis dot structures are shown. The left structures depict five C l symbols in a cross shape with eight dots around each, the word “or” and the same five C l symbols, connected by four single bonds in a cross shape. The name “Carbon tetrachloride” is written below the structure. The right hand structures show a S i symbol, surrounded by eight dots and four H symbols in a cross shape. The word “or” separates this from an S i symbol with four single bonds connecting the four H symbols in a cross shape. The name “Silane” is written below these diagrams." class="scaled-down">

<para id="fs-idm5630800">Group 15 elements such as nitrogen have five valence electrons in the atomic Lewis symbol: one lone pair and three unpaired electrons. To obtain an octet, these atoms form three covalent bonds, as in NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia). Oxygen and other atoms in group 16 obtain an octet by forming two covalent bonds:</para>
<media id="fs-idp15654864" alt="Three Lewis structures labeled, “Ammonia,” “Water,” and “Hydrogen fluoride” are shown. The left structure shows a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons and single bonded to three hydrogen atoms.

<title>Double and Triple Bonds</title>
<para id="fs-idp27538208">As previously mentioned, when a pair of atoms shares one pair of electrons, we call this a single bond. However, a pair of atoms may need to share more than one pair of electrons in order to achieve the requisite octet. A <term>double bond</term> forms when two pairs of electrons are shared between a pair of atoms, as between the carbon and oxygen atoms in CH<sub>2</sub>O (formaldehyde) and between the two carbon atoms in C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (ethylene):</para>
<media id="fs-idp172874320" alt="Two pairs of Lewis structures are shown. The left pair of structures shows a carbon atom forming single bonds to two hydrogen atoms.

A right-facing arrow leads to two more structures. The left shows two C atoms with four dots in between them and each forming single bonds to two H atoms.

<title>Writing Lewis Structures with the Octet Rule</title>

Lone pairs, unpaired electrons, and single, double, or triple bonds are used to indicate where the valence electrons are located around each atom in a Lewis structure. Most structures—especially those containing second row elements—obey the octet rule, in which every atom (except H) is surrounded by eight electrons.
