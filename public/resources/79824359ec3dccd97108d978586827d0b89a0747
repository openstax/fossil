<p id="fs-idp34966672">The nature of light has been a subject of inquiry since antiquity. In the seventeenth century, Isaac <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Newton</span> performed experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the individual colors of the rainbow combined together. Newton explained his optics findings in terms of a "corpuscular" view of light, in which light was composed of streams of extremely tiny particles travelling at high speeds according to Newton's laws of motion. Others in the seventeenth century, such as Christiaan <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Huygens</span>, had shown that optical phenomena such as reflection and refraction could be equally well explained in terms of light as waves travelling at high speed through a medium called "luminiferous aether" that was thought to permeate all space. Early in the nineteenth century, Thomas <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Young</span> demonstrated that light passing through narrow, closely spaced slits produced interference patterns that could not be explained in terms of Newtonian particles but could be easily explained in terms of waves. Later in the nineteenth century, after James Clerk <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Maxwell</span> developed his theory of <span data-type="term">electromagnetic radiation</span> and showed that light was the visible part of a vast spectrum of electromagnetic waves, the particle view of light became thoroughly discredited. By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists viewed the physical universe as roughly comprising two separate domains: matter composed of particles moving according to Newton's laws of motion, and electromagnetic radiation consisting of waves governed by Maxwell's equations. Today, these domains are referred to as classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics (or classical electromagnetism). Although there were a few physical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework, scientists at that time were so confident of the overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes that would ultimately be resolved somehow within this framework. As we shall see, these paradoxes led to a contemporary framework that intimately connects particles and waves at a fundamental level called wave-particle duality, which has superseded the classical view.</p>
<p id="fs-idp1759136">Visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation play important roles in chemistry, since they can be used to infer the energies of electrons within atoms and molecules. Much of modern technology is based on electromagnetic radiation. For example, radio waves from a mobile phone, X-rays used by dentists, the energy used to cook food in your microwave, the radiant heat from red-hot objects, and the light from your television screen are forms of electromagnetic radiation that all exhibit wavelike behavior.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm47435296"><h3 data-type="title">Waves</h3>
<p id="fs-idm45849552">A <span data-type="term">wave</span> is an oscillation or periodic movement that can transport energy from one point in space to another. Common examples of waves are all around us. Shaking the end of a rope transfers energy from your hand to the other end of the rope, dropping a pebble into a pond causes waves to ripple outward along the water's surface, and the expansion of air that accompanies a lightning strike generates sound waves (thunder) that can travel outward for several miles. In each of these cases, kinetic energy is transferred through matter (the rope, water, or air) while the matter remains essentially in place. An insightful example of a wave occurs in sports stadiums when fans in a narrow region of seats rise simultaneously and stand with their arms raised up for a few seconds before sitting down again while the fans in neighboring sections likewise stand up and sit down in sequence. While this wave can quickly encircle a large stadium in a few seconds, none of the fans actually travel with the wave-they all stay in or above their seats.</p>
<p id="fs-idm61288624">Waves need not be restricted to travel through matter. As Maxwell showed, electromagnetic waves consist of an electric field oscillating in step with a perpendicular magnetic field, both of which are perpendicular to the direction of travel. These waves can travel through a vacuum at a constant speed of 2.998 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mo>&#215;</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mo>&#215;</mo></annotation-xml></semantics></math> 10<sup>8</sup> m/s, the speed of light (denoted by <em data-effect="italics">c</em>).</p>
<p id="fs-idp150592048">All waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by, a <span data-type="term">wavelength</span> (denoted by <em data-effect="italics">&#955;</em>, the lowercase Greek letter lambda), a <span data-type="term">frequency</span> (denoted by <em data-effect="italics">&#957;</em>, the lowercase Greek letter nu), and an <span data-type="term">amplitude</span>. As can be seen in <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_Frequency" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an enormous range-wavelengths of kilometers (10<sup>3</sup> m) to picometers (10<sup>&#8722;12</sup> m) have been observed. The frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system, this is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit for frequency, expressed as cycles per second [s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>], is the <span data-type="term">hertz (Hz)</span>. Common multiples of this unit are megahertz, (1 MHz = 1 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mo>&#215;</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mo>&#215;</mo></annotation-xml></semantics></math> 10<sup>6</sup> Hz) and gigahertz (1 GHz = 1 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mo>&#215;</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mo>&#215;</mo></annotation-xml></semantics></math> 10<sup>9</sup> Hz). The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave's displacement and so, in <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_Frequency" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, this corresponds to one-half the height between the peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness.</p>

<p id="fs-idm80411056">Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional: As the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases. The inverse proportionality is illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_emspectrum" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. This figure also shows the <span data-type="term">electromagnetic spectrum</span>, the range of all types of electromagnetic radiation. Each of the various colors of visible light has specific frequencies and wavelengths associated with them, and you can see that visible light makes up only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because the technologies developed to work in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are different, for reasons of convenience and historical legacies, different units are typically used for different parts of the spectrum. For example, radio waves are usually specified as frequencies (typically in units of MHz), while the visible region is usually specified in wavelengths (typically in units of nm or angstroms).</p>

<p id="fs-idm82699072">Many valuable technologies operate in the radio (3 kHz-300 GHz) frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum. At the low frequency (low energy, long wavelength) end of this region are AM (amplitude modulation) radio signals (540-2830 kHz) that can travel long distances. FM (frequency modulation) radio signals are used at higher frequencies (87.5-108.0 MHz).

<p id="fs-idp85909232">Other technologies also operate in the radio-wave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, 4G cellular telephone signals are approximately 880 MHz, while Global Positioning System (GPS) signals operate at 1.228 and 1.575 GHz, local area wireless technology (Wi-Fi) networks operate at 2.4 to 5 GHz, and highway toll sensors operate at 5.8 GHz. The frequencies associated with these applications are convenient because such waves tend not to be absorbed much by common building materials.</p>

<p id="fs-idp67580224">One particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They interfere with each other. <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_LiteInterf" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the <span data-type="term">interference patterns</span> that arise when light passes through narrow slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits. When the light passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely spaced waves coming into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_LiteInterf" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> correspond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise, when two stones are tossed close together into a pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions between the waves produced by the stones. Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics.</p>

<p id="fs-idp35325744">Because the wavelengths of X-rays (10-10,000 picometers [pm]) are comparable to the size of atoms, X-rays can be used to determine the structure of molecules. When a beam of X-rays is passed through molecules packed together in a crystal, the X-rays collide with the electrons and scatter. Constructive and destructive interference of these scattered X-rays creates a specific diffraction pattern. Calculating backward from this pattern, the positions of each of the atoms in the molecule can be determined very precisely. One of the pioneers who helped create this technology was Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin.</p>
<p id="fs-idm57169680">She was born in Cairo, Egypt, in 1910, where her British parents were studying archeology. Even as a young girl, she was fascinated with minerals and crystals. When she was a student at Oxford University, she began researching how X-ray crystallography could be used to determine the structure of biomolecules. She invented new techniques that allowed her and her students to determine the structures of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, penicillin, and many other important molecules. Diabetes, a disease that affects 382 million people worldwide, involves the hormone insulin. Hodgkin began studying the structure of insulin in 1934, but it required several decades of advances in the field before she finally reported the structure in 1969. Understanding the structure has led to better understanding of the disease and treatment options.</p>

<p id="fs-idm64346880">Not all waves are travelling waves. <span data-type="term">Standing waves</span> (also known as <span data-type="term">stationary waves</span>) remain constrained within some region of space. As we shall see, standing waves play an important role in our understanding of the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. The simplest example of a standing wave is a one-dimensional wave associated with a vibrating string that is held fixed at its two end points. <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_Vibrstring" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the four lowest-energy standing waves (the fundamental wave and the lowest three harmonics) for a vibrating string at a particular amplitude. Although the string's motion lies mostly within a plane, the wave itself is considered to be one dimensional, since it lies along the length of the string. The motion of string segments in a direction perpendicular to the string length generates the waves and so the amplitude of the waves is visible as the maximum displacement of the curves seen in <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_Vibrstring" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The key observation from the figure is <em data-effect="italics">that only those waves having an integer number, n, of half-wavelengths between the end points can form</em>. A system with fixed end points such as this restricts the number and type of the possible waveforms. This is an example of <span data-type="term">quantization</span>, in which only discrete values from a more general set of continuous values of some property are observed. Another important observation is that the harmonic waves (those waves displaying more than one-half wavelength) all have one or more points between the two end points that are not in motion. These special points are <span data-type="term">nodes</span>. The energies of the standing waves with a given amplitude in a vibrating string increase with the number of half-wavelengths <em data-effect="italics">n</em>. Since the number of nodes is <em data-effect="italics">n</em> &#8211; 1, the energy can also be said to depend on the number of nodes, generally increasing as the number of nodes increases.</p>

<p id="fs-idm97113152">The last few decades of the nineteenth century witnessed intense research activity in commercializing newly discovered electric lighting. This required obtaining a better understanding of the distributions of light emitted from various sources being considered. Artificial lighting is usually designed to mimic natural sunlight within the limitations of the underlying technology. Such lighting consists of a range of broadly distributed frequencies that form a <span data-type="term">continuous spectrum</span>. <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_Solardist" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the wavelength distribution for sunlight. The most intense radiation is in the visible region, with the intensity dropping off rapidly for shorter wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light, and more slowly for longer wavelength infrared (IR) light.</p>

<p id="fs-idp69243952">In <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_Solardist" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the solar distribution is compared to a representative distribution, called a blackbody spectrum, that corresponds to a temperature of 5250 &#176;C. The blackbody spectrum matches the solar spectrum quite well. A <span data-type="term">blackbody</span> is a convenient, ideal emitter that approximates the behavior of many materials when heated. It is &#8220;ideal&#8221; in the same sense that an ideal gas is a convenient, simple representation of real gases that works well, provided that the pressure is not too high nor the temperature too low. A good approximation of a blackbody that can be used to observe blackbody radiation is a metal oven that can be heated to very high temperatures. The oven has a small hole allowing for the light being emitted within the oven to be observed with a spectrometer so that the wavelengths and their intensities can be measured. <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_Blackbody" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the resulting curves for some representative temperatures. Each distribution depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. The maxima in the blackbody curves, <em data-effect="italics">&#955;</em><sub>max</sub>, shift to shorter wavelengths as the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that metals being heated to high temperatures begin to glow a darker red that becomes brighter as the temperature increases, eventually becoming white hot at very high temperatures as the intensities of all of the visible wavelengths become appreciable. This common observation was at the heart of the first paradox that showed the fundamental limitations of classical physics that we will examine.</p>
<p id="fs-idp177373680">Physicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the &#8220;ultraviolet catastrophe&#8221; because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm77128544"><h3 data-type="title">The Photoelectric Effect</h3>
<p id="fs-idm38401792">The next paradox in the classical theory to be resolved concerned the photoelectric effect (<a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_Ephoton" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).</p>
<p id="fs-idp90299344">Einstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called <span data-type="term">photons</span>) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, <em data-effect="italics">E</em> = <em data-effect="italics">h&#957;</em> (or, in terms of wavelength using <em data-effect="italics">c</em> = <em data-effect="italics">&#957;&#955;</em>, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mi>h</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow><mi>&#955;</mi></mfrac></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mi>h</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow><mi>&#955;</mi></mfrac></mrow></annotation-xml></semantics></math>). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.</p>
<p id="fs-idm47327216">With Einstein's findings, the nature of light took on a new air of mystery. Although many light phenomena could be explained either in terms of waves or particles, certain phenomena, such as the interference patterns obtained when light passed through a double slit, were completely contrary to a particle view of light, while other phenomena, such as the photoelectric effect, were completely contrary to a wave view of light. Somehow, at a deep fundamental level still not fully understood, light is both wavelike and particle-like. This is known as <span data-type="term">wave-particle duality</span>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp70134432">Another paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_Solardist" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_Blackbody" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>
<p id="fs-idp274944">In contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or <span data-type="term">line spectra</span> having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_2spectra" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (<a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_neon" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.</p>

Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_06_01_2spectra" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p><figure id="CNX_Chem_06_01_2spectra"><figcaption>Compare the two types of emission spectra: continuous spectrum of white light (top) and the line spectra of the light from excited sodium, hydrogen, calcium, and mercury atoms.</figcaption>

That such a simple formula as the Rydberg formula could account for such precise measurements seemed astounding at the time, but it was the eventual explanation for emission spectra by Neils <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bohr</span> in 1913 that ultimately convinced scientists to abandon classical physics and spurred the development of modern quantum mechanics.</p>

<p id="fs-idp168057200">Light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, <em data-effect="italics">c</em>, of 2.998 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mo>&#215;</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mo>&#215;</mo></annotation-xml></semantics></math> 10<sup>8</sup> m s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, <em data-effect="italics">&#957;</em>, and a wavelength, <em data-effect="italics">&#955;</em>, such that <em data-effect="italics">c</em> = <em data-effect="italics">&#955;&#957;</em>. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as <em data-effect="italics">E</em> = <em data-effect="italics">h&#957;</em> (or <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mi>h</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow><mi>&#955;</mi></mfrac></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mi>h</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow><mi>&#955;</mi></mfrac></mrow></annotation-xml></semantics></math>), where <em data-effect="italics">h</em> is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from an electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.</p>
