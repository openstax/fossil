<p id="fs-idm49375088">In the previous section, we discussed how to write Lewis structures for molecules and polyatomic ions. As we have seen, however, in some cases, there is seemingly more than one valid structure for a molecule. We can use the concept of formal charges to help us predict the most appropriate Lewis structure when more than one is reasonable.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp11710128"><h3 data-type="title">Calculating Formal Charge</h3>
<p id="fs-idm16217792">The <span data-type="term">formal charge</span> of an atom in a molecule is the <em data-effect="italics">hypothetical</em> charge the atom would have if we could redistribute the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure.</p>
<p id="fs-idp126842624">Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows:</p>

</div>
<p id="fs-idp88204016">We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion.</p>
<p id="fs-idp15200480">We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the <em data-effect="italics">actual</em> charge of the atom in the molecule. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges.</p>

<p id="fs-idp93581584">The arrangement of atoms in a molecule or ion is called its <span data-type="term">molecular structure</span>. In many cases, following the steps for writing Lewis structures may lead to more than one possible molecular structure&#8212;different multiple bond and lone-pair electron placements or different arrangements of atoms, for instance. A few guidelines involving formal charge can be helpful in deciding which of the possible structures is most likely for a particular molecule or ion:</p>
<ol id="fs-idp69636800" type="1">
<li>A molecular structure in which all formal charges are zero is preferable to one in which some formal charges are not zero.</li>
<li>If the Lewis structure must have nonzero formal charges, the arrangement with the smallest nonzero formal charges is preferable.</li>
<li>Lewis structures are preferable when adjacent formal charges are zero or of the opposite sign.</li>
<li>When we must choose among several Lewis structures with similar distributions of formal charges, the structure with the negative formal charges on the more electronegative atoms is preferable.</li>
</ol>
<p id="fs-idp52450560">To see how these guidelines apply, let us consider some possible structures for carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>. We know from our previous discussion that the less electronegative atom typically occupies the central position, but formal charges allow us to understand <em data-effect="italics">why</em> this occurs. We can draw three possibilities for the structure: carbon in the center and double bonds, carbon in the center with a single and triple bond, and oxygen in the center with double bonds:</p>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idp21768928" data-alt="Three Lewis structures are shown. The left and right structures show a carbon atom double bonded to two oxygen atoms, each of which has two lone pairs of electrons. The center structure shows a carbon atom that is triple bonded to an oxygen atom with one lone pair of electrons and single bonded to an oxygen atom with three lone pairs of electrons. The third structure shows an oxygen atom double bonded to another oxygen atom with to lone pairs of electrons. The first oxygen atom is also double bonded to a carbon atom with two lone pairs of electrons." class="scaled-down">

</span>
<p id="fs-idp58268848">Comparing the three formal charges, we can definitively identify the structure on the left as preferable because it has only formal charges of zero (Guideline 1).</p>

The formal charges present in each of these molecular structures can help us pick the most likely arrangement of atoms.

<p id="fs-idm12853328">We should remember that a molecule described as a resonance hybrid <em data-effect="italics">never</em> possesses an electronic structure described by either resonance form. It does not fluctuate between resonance forms; rather, the actual electronic structure is <em data-effect="italics">always</em> the average of that shown by all resonance forms. George Wheland, one of the pioneers of resonance theory, used a historical analogy to describe the relationship between resonance forms and resonance hybrids. A medieval traveler, having never before seen a rhinoceros, described it as a hybrid of a dragon and a unicorn because it had many properties in common with both. Just as a rhinoceros is neither a dragon sometimes nor a unicorn at other times, a resonance hybrid is neither of its resonance forms at any given time. Like a rhinoceros, it is a real entity that experimental evidence has shown to exist. It has some characteristics in common with its resonance forms, but the resonance forms themselves are convenient, imaginary images (like the unicorn and the dragon).</p>

<p id="fs-idp6151664">One oxygen atom must have a double bond to carbon to complete the octet on the central atom. All oxygen atoms, however, are equivalent, and the double bond could form from any one of the three atoms. This gives rise to three resonance forms of the carbonate ion. Because we can write three identical resonance structures, we know that the actual arrangement of electrons in the carbonate ion is the average of the three structures. Again, experiments show that all three C&#8211;O bonds are exactly the same.</p>

<p id="fs-idp91470432">In a Lewis structure, formal charges can be assigned to each atom by treating each bond as if one-half of the electrons are assigned to each atom. These hypothetical formal charges are a guide to determining the most appropriate Lewis structure. A structure in which the formal charges are as close to zero as possible is preferred. Resonance occurs in cases where two or more Lewis structures with identical arrangements of atoms but different distributions of electrons can be written. The actual distribution of electrons (the resonance hybrid) is an average of the distribution indicated by the individual Lewis structures (the resonance forms).</p>
