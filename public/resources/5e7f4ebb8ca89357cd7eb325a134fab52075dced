<p id="fs-id1300989">The PNS is not as contained as the CNS because it is defined as everything that is not the CNS. Some peripheral structures are incorporated into the other organs of the body. In describing the anatomy of the PNS, it is necessary to describe the common structures, the nerves and the ganglia, as they are found in various parts of the body. Many of the neural structures that are incorporated into other organs are features of the digestive system; these structures are known as the <span data-type="term">enteric nervous system</span> and are a special subset of the PNS.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2582754"><h3 data-type="title">Ganglia</h3><p id="fs-id2831695">A ganglion is a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery. Ganglia can be categorized, for the most part, as either sensory ganglia or autonomic ganglia, referring to their primary functions. The most common type of sensory ganglion is a <span data-type="term">dorsal (posterior) root ganglion</span>. These ganglia are the cell bodies of neurons with axons that are sensory endings in the periphery, such as in the skin, and that extend into the CNS through the dorsal nerve root. The ganglion is an enlargement of the nerve root. Under microscopic inspection, it can be seen to include the cell bodies of the neurons, as well as bundles of fibers that are the posterior nerve root (<a href="#fig-ch13_04_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The cells of the dorsal root ganglion are unipolar cells, classifying them by shape. Also, the small round nuclei of satellite cells can be seen surrounding&#8212;as if they were orbiting&#8212;the neuron cell bodies.</p>

If you zoom in on the dorsal root ganglion, you can see smaller satellite glial cells surrounding the large cell bodies of the sensory neurons. From what structure do satellite cells derive during embryologic development?</p></div><p id="fs-id1334448">Another type of sensory ganglion is a <span data-type="term">cranial nerve ganglion</span>. This is analogous to the dorsal root ganglion, except that it is associated with a <span data-type="term">cranial nerve</span> instead of a <span data-type="term">spinal nerve</span>. The roots of cranial nerves are within the cranium, whereas the ganglia are outside the skull. For example, the <span data-type="term">trigeminal ganglion</span> is superficial to the temporal bone whereas its associated nerve is attached to the mid-pons region of the brain stem. The neurons of cranial nerve ganglia are also unipolar in shape with associated satellite cells.</p>
<p id="fs-id1553818">The other major category of ganglia are those of the autonomic nervous system, which is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The <span data-type="term">sympathetic chain ganglia</span> constitute a row of ganglia along the vertebral column that receive central input from the lateral horn of the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord. Superior to the chain ganglia are three <span data-type="term">paravertebral ganglia</span> in the cervical region. Three other autonomic ganglia that are related to the sympathetic chain are the <span data-type="term">prevertebral ganglia</span>, which are located outside of the chain but have similar functions. They are referred to as prevertebral because they are anterior to the vertebral column. The neurons of these autonomic ganglia are multipolar in shape, with dendrites radiating out around the cell body where synapses from the spinal cord neurons are made. The neurons of the chain, paravertebral, and prevertebral ganglia then project to organs in the head and neck, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities to regulate the sympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms.</p>
<p id="fs-id1144493">Another group of autonomic ganglia are the <span data-type="term">terminal ganglia</span> that receive input from cranial nerves or sacral spinal nerves and are responsible for regulating the parasympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms. These two sets of ganglia, sympathetic and parasympathetic, often project to the same organs&#8212;one input from the chain ganglia and one input from a terminal ganglion&#8212;to regulate the overall function of an organ. For example, the heart receives two inputs such as these; one increases heart rate, and the other decreases it. The terminal ganglia that receive input from cranial nerves are found in the head and neck, as well as the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities, whereas the terminal ganglia that receive sacral input are in the lower abdominal and pelvic cavities.</p>
<p id="fs-id1124389">Terminal ganglia below the head and neck are often incorporated into the wall of the target organ as a <span data-type="term">plexus</span>. A plexus, in a general sense, is a network of fibers or vessels. This can apply to nervous tissue (as in this instance) or structures containing blood vessels (such as a choroid plexus). For example, the <span data-type="term">enteric plexus</span> is the extensive network of axons and neurons in the wall of the small and large intestines. The enteric plexus is actually part of the enteric nervous system, along with the <span data-type="term">gastric plexuses</span> and the <span data-type="term">esophageal plexus</span>. Though the enteric nervous system receives input originating from central neurons of the autonomic nervous system, it does not require CNS input to function. In fact, it operates independently to regulate the digestive system.</p>
</section><section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1942417"><h3 data-type="title">Nerves</h3><p id="fs-id1287072">Bundles of axons in the PNS are referred to as nerves. These structures in the periphery are different than the central counterpart, called a tract. Nerves are composed of more than just nervous tissue. They have connective tissues invested in their structure, as well as blood vessels supplying the tissues with nourishment. The outer surface of a nerve is a surrounding layer of fibrous connective tissue called the <span data-type="term">epineurium</span>. Within the nerve, axons are further bundled into <span data-type="term">fascicles</span>, which are each surrounded by their own layer of fibrous connective tissue called <span data-type="term">perineurium</span>. Finally, individual axons are surrounded by loose connective tissue called the <span data-type="term">endoneurium</span> (<a href="#fig-ch13_04_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). These three layers are similar to the connective tissue sheaths for muscles. Nerves are associated with the region of the CNS to which they are connected, either as cranial nerves connected to the brain or spinal nerves connected to the spinal cord.</p>

With what structures in a skeletal muscle are the endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium comparable?</p></div><section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1335222"><h4 data-type="title">Cranial Nerves</h4>
<p id="fs-id1490633">The nerves attached to the brain are the cranial nerves, which are primarily responsible for the sensory and motor functions of the head and neck (one of these nerves targets organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities as part of the parasympathetic nervous system). There are twelve cranial nerves, which are designated CNI through CNXII for &#8220;Cranial Nerve,&#8221; using Roman numerals for 1 through 12. They can be classified as sensory nerves, motor nerves, or a combination of both, meaning that the axons in these nerves originate out of sensory ganglia external to the cranium or motor nuclei within the brain stem. Sensory axons enter the brain to synapse in a nucleus. Motor axons connect to skeletal muscles of the head or neck. Three of the nerves are solely composed of sensory fibers; five are strictly motor; and the remaining four are mixed nerves.</p>
<p id="fs-id1107187">Learning the cranial nerves is a tradition in anatomy courses, and students have always used mnemonic devices to remember the nerve names. A traditional mnemonic is the rhyming couplet, &#8220;On Old Olympus&#8217; Towering Tops/A Finn And German Viewed Some Hops,&#8221; in which the initial letter of each word corresponds to the initial letter in the name of each nerve. The names of the nerves have changed over the years to reflect current usage and more accurate naming. An exercise to help learn this sort of information is to generate a mnemonic using words that have personal significance. The names of the cranial nerves are listed in <a href="#tbl-ch13_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> along with a brief description of their function, their source (sensory ganglion or motor nucleus), and their target (sensory nucleus or skeletal muscle). They are listed here with a brief explanation of each nerve (<a href="#fig-ch13_04_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p><p id="fs-id1271098">The <span data-type="term">olfactory nerve</span> and <span data-type="term">optic nerve</span> are responsible for the sense of smell and vision, respectively. The <span data-type="term">oculomotor nerve</span> is responsible for eye movements by controlling four of the <span data-type="term">extraocular muscles</span>. It is also responsible for lifting the upper eyelid when the eyes point up, and for pupillary constriction. The <span data-type="term">trochlear nerve</span> and the <span data-type="term">abducens nerve</span> are both responsible for eye movement, but do so by controlling different extraocular muscles. The <span data-type="term">trigeminal nerve</span> is responsible for cutaneous sensations of the face and controlling the muscles of mastication. The <span data-type="term">facial nerve</span> is responsible for the muscles involved in facial expressions, as well as part of the sense of taste and the production of saliva. The <span data-type="term">vestibulocochlear nerve</span> is responsible for the senses of hearing and balance. The <span data-type="term">glossopharyngeal nerve</span> is responsible for controlling muscles in the oral cavity and upper throat, as well as part of the sense of taste and the production of saliva. The <span data-type="term">vagus nerve</span> is responsible for contributing to homeostatic control of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities. The <span data-type="term">spinal accessory nerve</span> is responsible for controlling the muscles of the neck, along with cervical spinal nerves. The <span data-type="term">hypoglossal nerve</span> is responsible for controlling the muscles of the lower throat and tongue.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-id674898">Three of the cranial nerves also contain autonomic fibers, and a fourth is almost purely a component of the autonomic system. The oculomotor, facial, and glossopharyngeal nerves contain fibers that contact autonomic ganglia. The oculomotor fibers initiate pupillary constriction, whereas the facial and glossopharyngeal fibers both initiate salivation. The vagus nerve primarily targets autonomic ganglia in the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities.</p>
<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id1492164" class="anatomy interactive" data-label="">
<p id="fs-id1533637">Visit this <a href="http://openstax.org/l/NYTmeningitis">site</a> to read about a man who wakes with a headache and a loss of vision. His regular doctor sent him to an ophthalmologist to address the vision loss. The ophthalmologist recognizes a greater problem and immediately sends him to the emergency room. Once there, the patient undergoes a large battery of tests, but a definite cause cannot be found. A specialist recognizes the problem as meningitis, but the question is what caused it originally. How can that be cured? The loss of vision comes from swelling around the optic nerve, which probably presented as a bulge on the inside of the eye. Why is swelling related to meningitis going to push on the optic nerve?</p>
</div><p id="fs-id1830197">Another important aspect of the cranial nerves that lends itself to a mnemonic is the functional role each nerve plays. The nerves fall into one of three basic groups. They are sensory, motor, or both (see <a href="#tbl-ch13_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The sentence, &#8220;Some Say Marry Money But My Brother Says Brains Beauty Matter More,&#8221; corresponds to the basic function of each nerve. The first, second, and eighth nerves are purely sensory: the olfactory (CNI), optic (CNII), and vestibulocochlear (CNVIII) nerves. The three eye-movement nerves are all motor: the oculomotor (CNIII), trochlear (CNIV), and abducens (CNVI). The spinal accessory (CNXI) and hypoglossal (CNXII) nerves are also strictly motor. The remainder of the nerves contain both sensory and motor fibers. They are the trigeminal (CNV), facial (CNVII), glossopharyngeal (CNIX), and vagus (CNX) nerves. The nerves that convey both are often related to each other. The trigeminal and facial nerves both concern the face; one concerns the sensations and the other concerns the muscle movements. The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are both responsible for conveying gustatory, or taste, sensations as well as controlling salivary glands. The vagus nerve is involved in visceral responses to taste, namely the gag reflex. This is not an exhaustive list of what these combination nerves do, but there is a thread of relation between them.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1502532"><h4 data-type="title">Spinal Nerves</h4><p id="fs-id1119780">The nerves connected to the spinal cord are the spinal nerves. The arrangement of these nerves is much more regular than that of the cranial nerves. All of the spinal nerves are combined sensory and motor axons that separate into two nerve roots. The sensory axons enter the spinal cord as the dorsal nerve root. The motor fibers, both somatic and autonomic, emerge as the ventral nerve root. The dorsal root ganglion for each nerve is an enlargement of the spinal nerve.</p>
<p id="fs-id1119463">There are 31 spinal nerves, named for the level of the spinal cord at which each one emerges. There are eight pairs of cervical nerves designated C1 to C8, twelve thoracic nerves designated T1 to T12, five pairs of lumbar nerves designated L1 to L5, five pairs of sacral nerves designated S1 to S5, and one pair of coccygeal nerves. The nerves are numbered from the superior to inferior positions, and each emerges from the vertebral column through the intervertebral foramen at its level. The first nerve, C1, emerges between the first cervical vertebra and the occipital bone. The second nerve, C2, emerges between the first and second cervical vertebrae. The same occurs for C3 to C7, but C8 emerges between the seventh cervical vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra. For the thoracic and lumbar nerves, each one emerges between the vertebra that has the same designation and the next vertebra in the column. The sacral nerves emerge from the sacral foramina along the length of that unique vertebra.</p>
<p id="fs-id1196887">Spinal nerves extend outward from the vertebral column to enervate the periphery. The nerves in the periphery are not straight continuations of the spinal nerves, but rather the reorganization of the axons in those nerves to follow different courses. Axons from different spinal nerves will come together into a <span data-type="term">systemic nerve</span>. This occurs at four places along the length of the vertebral column, each identified as a <span data-type="term">nerve plexus</span>, whereas the other spinal nerves directly correspond to nerves at their respective levels. In this instance, the word plexus is used to describe networks of nerve fibers with no associated cell bodies.</p>
<p id="fs-id1472046">Of the four nerve plexuses, two are found at the cervical level, one at the lumbar level, and one at the sacral level (<a href="#fig-ch13_04_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The <span data-type="term">cervical plexus</span> is composed of axons from spinal nerves C1 through C5 and branches into nerves in the posterior neck and head, as well as the <span data-type="term">phrenic nerve</span>, which connects to the diaphragm at the base of the thoracic cavity. The other plexus from the cervical level is the <span data-type="term">brachial plexus</span>. Spinal nerves C4 through T1 reorganize through this plexus to give rise to the nerves of the arms, as the name brachial suggests. A large nerve from this plexus is the <span data-type="term">radial nerve</span> from which the <span data-type="term">axillary nerve</span> branches to go to the armpit region. The radial nerve continues through the arm and is paralleled by the <span data-type="term">ulnar nerve</span> and the <span data-type="term">median nerve</span>. The <span data-type="term">lumbar plexus</span> arises from all the lumbar spinal nerves and gives rise to nerves enervating the pelvic region and the anterior leg. The <span data-type="term">femoral nerve</span> is one of the major nerves from this plexus, which gives rise to the <span data-type="term">saphenous nerve</span> as a branch that extends through the anterior lower leg. The <span data-type="term">sacral plexus</span> comes from the lower lumbar nerves L4 and L5 and the sacral nerves S1 to S4. The most significant systemic nerve to come from this plexus is the <span data-type="term">sciatic nerve</span>, which is a combination of the <span data-type="term">tibial nerve</span> and the <span data-type="term">fibular nerve</span>. The sciatic nerve extends across the hip joint and is most commonly associated with the condition <span data-type="term">sciatica</span>, which is the result of compression or irritation of the nerve or any of the spinal nerves giving rise to it.</p>
<p id="fs-id1064165">These plexuses are described as arising from spinal nerves and giving rise to certain systemic nerves, but they contain fibers that serve sensory functions or fibers that serve motor functions. This means that some fibers extend from cutaneous or other peripheral sensory surfaces and send action potentials into the CNS. Those are axons of sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia that enter the spinal cord through the dorsal nerve root. Other fibers are the axons of motor neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, which emerge in the ventral nerve root and send action potentials to cause skeletal muscles to contract in their target regions. For example, the radial nerve contains fibers of cutaneous sensation in the arm, as well as motor fibers that move muscles in the arm.</p>
<p id="fs-id1475794">Spinal nerves of the thoracic region, T2 through T11, are not part of the plexuses but rather emerge and give rise to the <span data-type="term">intercostal nerves</span> found between the ribs, which articulate with the vertebrae surrounding the spinal nerve.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch13_04_06"><div data-type="title">Nerve Plexuses of the Body </div><figcaption>There are four main nerve plexuses in the human body.

<p id="fs-id1521213"><span data-type="title">Nervous System</span>
Anosmia is the loss of the sense of smell. It is often the result of the olfactory nerve being severed, usually because of blunt force trauma to the head. The sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium have a limited lifespan of approximately one to four months, and new ones are made on a regular basis. The new neurons extend their axons into the CNS by growing along the existing fibers of the olfactory nerve. The ability of these neurons to be replaced is lost with age. Age-related anosmia is not the result of impact trauma to the head, but rather a slow loss of the sensory neurons with no new neurons born to replace them.</p>
<p id="fs-id1258027">Smell is an important sense, especially for the enjoyment of food. There are only five tastes sensed by the tongue, and two of them are generally thought of as unpleasant tastes (sour and bitter). The rich sensory experience of food is the result of odor molecules associated with the food, both as food is moved into the mouth, and therefore passes under the nose, and when it is chewed and molecules are released to move up the pharynx into the posterior nasal cavity. Anosmia results in a loss of the enjoyment of food.</p>
<p id="fs-id1211885">As the replacement of olfactory neurons declines with age, anosmia can set in. Without the sense of smell, many sufferers complain of food tasting bland. Often, the only way to enjoy food is to add seasoning that can be sensed on the tongue, which usually means adding table salt. The problem with this solution, however, is that this increases sodium intake, which can lead to cardiovascular problems through water retention and the associated increase in blood pressure.</p>

<p id="fs-id1733362">The PNS is composed of the groups of neurons (ganglia) and bundles of axons (nerves) that are outside of the brain and spinal cord. Ganglia are of two types, sensory or autonomic. Sensory ganglia contain unipolar sensory neurons and are found on the dorsal root of all spinal nerves as well as associated with many of the cranial nerves. Autonomic ganglia are in the sympathetic chain, the associated paravertebral or prevertebral ganglia, or in terminal ganglia near or within the organs controlled by the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p id="fs-id1594972">Nerves are classified as cranial nerves or spinal nerves on the basis of their connection to the brain or spinal cord, respectively. The twelve cranial nerves can be strictly sensory in function, strictly motor in function, or a combination of the two functions. Sensory fibers are axons of sensory ganglia that carry sensory information into the brain and target sensory nuclei. Motor fibers are axons of motor neurons in motor nuclei of the brain stem and target skeletal muscles of the head and neck. Spinal nerves are all mixed nerves with both sensory and motor fibers. Spinal nerves emerge from the spinal cord and reorganize through plexuses, which then give rise to systemic nerves. Thoracic spinal nerves are not part of any plexus, but give rise to the intercostal nerves directly.</p>

<p id="fs-id1334506">Visit this <a href="http://openstax.org/l/NYTmeningitis">site</a> to read about a man who wakes with a headache and a loss of vision. His regular doctor sent him to an ophthalmologist to address the vision loss. The ophthalmologist recognizes a greater problem and immediately sends him to the emergency room. Once there, the patient undergoes a large battery of tests, but a definite cause cannot be found. A specialist recognizes the problem as meningitis, but the question is what caused it originally. How can that be cured? The loss of vision comes from swelling around the optic nerve, which probably presented as a bulge on the inside of the eye. Why is swelling related to meningitis going to push on the optic nerve?</p></div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1641271" data-label="">
<p id="fs-id1497167">The optic nerve enters the CNS in its projection from the eyes in the periphery, which means that it crosses through the meninges. Meningitis will include swelling of those protective layers of the CNS, resulting in pressure on the optic nerve, which can compromise vision.</p></div>
