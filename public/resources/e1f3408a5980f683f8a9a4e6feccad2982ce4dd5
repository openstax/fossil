<p id="fs-idp26683312">It has long been known that pure carbon occurs in different forms (allotropes) including graphite and diamonds. But it was not until 1985 that a new form of carbon was recognized: buckminsterfullerene. This molecule was named after the architect and inventor R. Buckminster <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Fuller</span> (1895&#8211;1983), whose signature architectural design was the geodesic dome, characterized by a lattice shell structure supporting a spherical surface. Experimental evidence revealed the formula, C<sub>60</sub>, and then scientists determined how 60 carbon atoms could form one symmetric, stable molecule. They were guided by bonding theory&#8212;the topic of this chapter&#8212;which explains how individual atoms connect to form more complex structures.</p>
