<li>Identify the appendicular muscles of the pelvic girdle and lower limb</li>

</ul></div>
<p id="fs-id2797217">The appendicular muscles of the lower body position and stabilize the <span data-type="term">pelvic girdle</span>, which serves as a foundation for the lower limbs. Comparatively, there is much more movement at the pectoral girdle than at the pelvic girdle. There is very little movement of the pelvic girdle because of its connection with the sacrum at the base of the axial skeleton. The pelvic girdle is less range of motion because it was designed to stabilize and support the body.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id3033610"><h3 data-type="title">Muscles of the Thigh</h3>
<p id="fs-id2303409">What would happen if the pelvic girdle, which attaches the lower limbs to the torso, were capable of the same range of motion as the pectoral girdle? For one thing, walking would expend more energy if the heads of the femurs were not secured in the acetabula of the pelvis. The body&#8217;s center of gravity is in the area of the pelvis. If the center of gravity were not to remain fixed, standing up would be difficult as well. Therefore, what the leg muscles lack in range of motion and versatility, they make up for in size and power, facilitating the body&#8217;s stabilization, posture, and movement.</p>

The muscles in this compartment are large and strong and keep humans upright. The most superficial and visible muscle of the calf is the <span data-type="term">gastrocnemius</span>. Deep to the gastrocnemius is the wide, flat <span data-type="term">soleus</span>. The <span data-type="term">plantaris</span> runs obliquely between the two; some people may have two of these muscles, whereas no plantaris is observed in about seven percent of other cadaver dissections. The plantaris tendon is a desirable substitute for the fascia lata in hernia repair, tendon transplants, and repair of ligaments. There are four deep muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg as well: the <span data-type="term">popliteus</span>, <span data-type="term">flexor digitorum longus</span>, <span data-type="term">flexor hallucis longus</span>, and <span data-type="term">tibialis posterior</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-id1364833">The foot also has intrinsic muscles, which originate and insert within it (similar to the intrinsic muscles of the hand). These muscles primarily provide support for the foot and its arch, and contribute to movements of the toes (<a href="#fig-ch11_06_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#fig-ch11_06_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The principal support for the longitudinal arch of the foot is a deep fascia called <span data-type="term">plantar aponeurosis</span>, which runs from the calcaneus bone to the toes (inflammation of this tissue is the cause of &#8220;plantar fasciitis,&#8221; which can affect runners. The intrinsic muscles of the foot consist of two groups. The <span data-type="term">dorsal group</span> includes only one muscle, the <span data-type="term">extensor digitorum brevis</span>.

<p id="fs-id1546298">The pelvic girdle attaches the legs to the axial skeleton. The hip joint is where the pelvic girdle and the leg come together. The hip is joined to the pelvic girdle by many muscles. In the gluteal region, the psoas major and iliacus form the iliopsoas. The large and strong gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus extend and abduct the femur. Along with the gluteus maximus, the tensor fascia lata muscle forms the iliotibial tract. The lateral rotators of the femur at the hip are the piriformis, obturator internus, obturator externus, superior gemellus, inferior gemellus, and quadratus femoris. On the medial part of the thigh, the adductor longus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus adduct the thigh and medially rotate it. The pectineus muscle adducts and flexes the femur at the hip.</p>
<p id="fs-id1748045">The thigh muscles that move the femur, tibia, and fibula are divided into medial, anterior, and posterior compartments. The medial compartment includes the adductors, pectineus, and the gracilis. The anterior compartment comprises the quadriceps femoris, quadriceps tendon, patellar ligament, and the sartorius. The quadriceps femoris is made of four muscles: the rectus femoris, the vastus lateralis, the vastus medius, and the vastus intermedius, which together extend the knee. The posterior compartment of the thigh includes the hamstrings: the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and the semimembranosus, which all flex the knee.</p>
<p id="fs-id1748928">The muscles of the leg that move the foot and toes are divided into anterior, lateral, superficial- and deep-posterior compartments. The anterior compartment includes the tibialis anterior, the extensor hallucis longus, the extensor digitorum longus, and the fibularis (peroneus) tertius. The lateral compartment houses the fibularis (peroneus) longus and the fibularis (peroneus) brevis. The superficial posterior compartment has the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris; and the deep posterior compartment has the popliteus, tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus.</p>
