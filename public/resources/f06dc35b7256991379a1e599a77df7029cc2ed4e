<para id="fs-idm10764416">Thus far, the ideal gas law, <emphasis effect="italics">PV = nRT</emphasis>, has been applied to a variety of different types of problems, ranging from reaction stoichiometry and empirical and molecular formula problems to determining the density and molar mass of a gas. As mentioned in the previous modules of this chapter, however, the behavior of a gas is often non-ideal, meaning that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperature are not accurately described by the gas laws. In this section, the reasons for these deviations from ideal gas behavior are considered.</para>
<para id="fs-idp138594304">One way in which the accuracy of <emphasis effect="italics">PV = nRT</emphasis> can be judged is by comparing the actual volume of 1 mole of gas (its molar volume, <emphasis effect="italics">V</emphasis><sub>m</sub>) to the molar volume of an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure. This ratio is called the <term>compressibility factor (Z)</term> with:</para>

The vertical axis is labeled, “Z le( k P a ).” This scale begins at zero and includes multiples of 0.5 up to 2.0. Six curves are drawn of varying colors. One of these curves is a horizontal, light purple line extending right from 1.0 k P a on the vertical axis, which is labeled “Ideal gas.” The region of the graph beneath this line is shaded tan. The remaining curves also start at the same point on the vertical axis. An orange line extends to the upper right corner of the graph, reaching a value of approximately 1.7 k P a at 1000 a t m. This orange curve is labeled, “H subscript 2.” A blue curve dips below the horizontal ideal gas line initially, then increases to cross the line just past 200 a t m. This curve reaches a value of nearly 2.0 k P a at about 800 a t m. This curve is labeled, “N subscript 2.” A red curve dips below the horizontal ideal gas line initially, then increases to cross the line just past 400 a t m. This curve reaches a value of nearly 1.5 k P a at about 750 a t m. This curve is labeled, “O subscript 2.” A purple curve dips below the horizontal ideal gas line, dipping even lower than the O subscript 2 curve initially, then increases to cross the ideal gas line at about 400 a t m.

This curve is labeled, “C H subscript 4.” A yellow curve dips below the horizontal ideal gas line, dipping lower than the other curves to a minimum of about 0.4 k P a at about 0.75 a t m, then increases to cross the ideal gas line at about 500 a t m.

<para id="fs-idp70317840">As is apparent from <link target-id="CNX_Chem_09_06_ZvsPgraph"/>, the ideal gas law does not describe gas behavior well at relatively high pressures. To determine why this is, consider the differences between real gas properties and what is expected of a hypothetical ideal gas.</para>
<para id="fs-idp26015584">Particles of a hypothetical ideal gas have no significant volume and do not attract or repel each other. In general, real gases approximate this behavior at relatively low pressures and high temperatures. However, at high pressures, the molecules of a gas are crowded closer together, and the amount of empty space between the molecules is reduced. At these higher pressures, the volume of the gas molecules themselves becomes appreciable relative to the total volume occupied by the gas. The gas therefore becomes less compressible at these high pressures, and although its volume continues to decrease with increasing pressure, this decrease is not <emphasis effect="italics">proportional</emphasis> as predicted by Boyle’s law.</para>
<para id="fs-idp46559584">At relatively low pressures, gas molecules have practically no attraction for one another because they are (on average) so far apart, and they behave almost like particles of an ideal gas. At higher pressures, however, the force of attraction is also no longer insignificant. This force pulls the molecules a little closer together, slightly decreasing the pressure (if the volume is constant) or decreasing the volume (at constant pressure) (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_09_06_RealGas2"/>). This change is more pronounced at low temperatures because the molecules have lower KE relative to the attractive forces, and so they are less effective in overcoming these attractions after colliding with one another.</para>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_09_06_RealGas2">
<media id="fs-idm161409328" alt="This figure includes two diagrams. Each involves two lavender shaded boxes that contain 14 relatively evenly distributed, purple spheres. The first box in a on the left is labeled “ideal.” In the second slightly smaller box, on the right, a nearly centrally located purple sphere has 6 double-headed arrows extending outward from it to nearby spheres. This box is labeled “real.” In b, in the first box on the left, a single arrow points to a purple sphere at the right side that appears to be moving and impacting the right side of the box. There are no other spheres positioned near the right edge. This box is labeled “ideal.” The second box, on the right, shows the same image but has 5 double-headed arrows radiating out to the top, bottom, and left to other spheres. This box is labeled “real.”">

<caption>(a) Attractions between gas molecules serve to decrease the gas volume at constant pressure compared to an ideal gas whose molecules experience no attractive forces. (b) These attractive forces will decrease the force of collisions between the molecules and container walls, therefore reducing the pressure exerted at constant volume compared to an ideal gas.</caption>

<para id="fs-idm16170960">There are several different equations that better approximate gas behavior than does the ideal gas law. The first, and simplest, of these was developed by the Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals in 1879. The <term>van der Waals equation</term> improves upon the ideal gas law by adding two terms: one to account for the volume of the gas molecules and another for the attractive forces between them.</para>
<media id="fs-idm139964416" alt="This figure shows the equation P V equals n R T, with the P in blue text and the V in red text. This equation is followed by a right pointing arrow. Following this arrow, to the right in blue text appears the equation ( P minus a n superscript 2 divided by V squared ),” which is followed by the red text ( V minus n b ). This is followed in black text with equals n R T. Beneath the second equation appears the label, “Correction for molecular attraction” which is connected with a line segment to V squared. A second label, “Correction for volume of molecules,” is similarly connected to n b which appears in red." class="scaled-down">

<para id="fs-idp95888368">At low pressures, the correction for intermolecular attraction, <emphasis effect="italics">a</emphasis>, is more important than the one for molecular volume, <emphasis effect="italics">b</emphasis>. At high pressures and small volumes, the correction for the volume of the molecules becomes important because the molecules themselves are incompressible and constitute an appreciable fraction of the total volume. At some intermediate pressure, the two corrections have opposing influences and the gas appears to follow the relationship given by <emphasis effect="italics">PV = nRT</emphasis> over a small range of pressures. This behavior is reflected by the “dips” in several of the compressibility curves shown in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_09_06_ZvsPgraph"/>. The attractive force between molecules initially makes the gas more compressible than an ideal gas, as pressure is raised (Z decreases with increasing <emphasis effect="italics">P</emphasis>). At very high pressures, the gas becomes less compressible (Z increases with <emphasis effect="italics">P</emphasis>), as the gas molecules begin to occupy an increasingly significant fraction of the total gas volume.</para>
<para id="fs-idp87631424">Strictly speaking, the ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions between gas molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an appreciable part of the whole volume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of <emphasis effect="italics">low pressure and high temperature</emphasis>. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave ideally, and deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be disregarded—this is, however, very often not the case.</para>

<para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="fs-idm3555504">Gas molecules possess a finite volume and experience forces of attraction for one another. Consequently, gas behavior is not necessarily described well by the ideal gas law. Under conditions of low pressure and high temperature, these factors are negligible, the ideal gas equation is an accurate description of gas behavior, and the gas is said to exhibit ideal behavior. However, at lower temperatures and higher pressures, corrections for molecular volume and molecular attractions are required to account for finite molecular size and attractive forces. The van der Waals equation is a modified version of the ideal gas law that can be used to account for the non-ideal behavior of gases under these conditions.</para></section>

<para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="fs-idp26561024">(a) A straight horizontal line at 1.0; (b) When real gases are at low pressures and high temperatures, they behave close enough to ideal gases that they are approximated as such; however, in some cases, we see that at a high pressure and temperature, the ideal gas approximation breaks down and is significantly different from the pressure calculated by the ideal gas equation. (c) The greater the compressibility, the more the volume matters. At low pressures, the correction factor for intermolecular attractions is more significant, and the effect of the volume of the gas molecules on Z would be a small lowering compressibility. At higher pressures, the effect of the volume of the gas molecules themselves on Z would increase compressibility (see <link target-id="CNX_Chem_09_06_ZvsPgraph"/>). (d) Once again, at low pressures, the effect of intermolecular attractions on Z would be more important than the correction factor for the volume of the gas molecules themselves, though perhaps still small.
