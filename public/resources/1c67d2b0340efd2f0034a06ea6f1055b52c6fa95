<p id="fs-id2310613">It is a complex job to balance the body on two feet and walk upright. The muscles of the vertebral column, thorax, and abdominal wall extend, flex, and stabilize different parts of the body&#8217;s trunk. The deep muscles of the core of the body help maintain posture as well as carry out other functions. The brain sends out electrical impulses to these various muscle groups to control posture by alternate contraction and relaxation. This is necessary so that no single muscle group becomes fatigued too quickly. If any one group fails to function, body posture will be compromised.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2133048"><h3 data-type="title">Muscles of the Abdomen</h3>
<p id="fs-id2241972">There are four pairs of abdominal muscles that cover the anterior and lateral abdominal region and meet at the anterior midline. These muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall can be divided into four groups: the external obliques, the internal obliques, the transversus abdominis, and the rectus abdominis (<a href="#fig-ch11_04_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#tbl-ch11_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p><figure id="fig-ch11_04_01"><div data-type="title">Muscles of the Abdomen </div><figcaption>(a) The anterior abdominal muscles include the medially located rectus abdominis, which is covered by a sheet of connective tissue called the rectus sheath.

<p id="fs-id2830198">There are three flat skeletal muscles in the antero-lateral wall of the abdomen. The <span data-type="term">external oblique</span>, closest to the surface, extend inferiorly and medially, in the direction of sliding one&#8217;s four fingers into pants pockets. Perpendicular to it is the intermediate <span data-type="term">internal oblique</span>, extending superiorly and medially, the direction the thumbs usually go when the other fingers are in the pants pocket. The deep muscle, the <span data-type="term">transversus abdominis</span>, is arranged transversely around the abdomen, similar to the front of a belt on a pair of pants. This arrangement of three bands of muscles in different orientations allows various movements and rotations of the trunk. The three layers of muscle also help to protect the internal abdominal organs in an area where there is no bone.</p>
<p id="fs-id2429994">The <span data-type="term">linea alba</span> is a white, fibrous band that is made of the bilateral <span data-type="term">rectus sheaths</span> that join at the anterior midline of the body. These enclose the <span data-type="term">rectus abdominis</span> muscles (a pair of long, linear muscles, commonly called the &#8220;sit-up&#8221; muscles) that originate at the pubic crest and symphysis, and extend the length of the body&#8217;s trunk. Each muscle is segmented by three transverse bands of collagen fibers called the <span data-type="term">tendinous intersections</span>. This results in the look of &#8220;six-pack abs,&#8221; as each segment hypertrophies on individuals at the gym who do many sit-ups.</p>
<p id="fs-id2738851">The posterior abdominal wall is formed by the lumbar vertebrae, parts of the ilia of the hip bones, psoas major and iliacus muscles, and <span data-type="term">quadratus lumborum</span> muscle. This part of the core plays a key role in stabilizing the rest of the body and maintaining posture.</p>

<p id="fs-id2003817"><span data-type="title">Physical Therapists</span>
Those who have a muscle or joint injury will most likely be sent to a physical therapist (PT) after seeing their regular doctor. PTs have a master&#8217;s degree or doctorate, and are highly trained experts in the mechanics of body movements. Many PTs also specialize in sports injuries.</p>
<p id="fs-id2008752">If you injured your shoulder while you were kayaking, the first thing a physical therapist would do during your first visit is to assess the functionality of the joint. The range of motion of a particular joint refers to the normal movements the joint performs. The PT will ask you to abduct and adduct, circumduct, and flex and extend the arm. The PT will note the shoulder&#8217;s degree of function, and based on the assessment of the injury, will create an appropriate physical therapy plan.</p>
<p id="fs-id1850593">The first step in physical therapy will probably be applying a heat pack to the injured site, which acts much like a warm-up to draw blood to the area, to enhance healing. You will be instructed to do a series of exercises to continue the therapy at home, followed by icing, to decrease inflammation and swelling, which will continue for several weeks. When physical therapy is complete, the PT will do an exit exam and send a detailed report on the improved range of motion and return of normal limb function to your doctor. Gradually, as the injury heals, the shoulder will begin to function correctly. A PT works closely with patients to help them get back to their normal level of physical activity.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1296892"><h4 data-type="title">The Diaphragm</h4>
<p id="fs-id2974297">The change in volume of the thoracic cavity during breathing is due to the alternate contraction and relaxation of the <span data-type="term">diaphragm</span> (<a href="#fig-ch11_04_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). It separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities, and is dome-shaped at rest. The superior surface of the diaphragm is convex, creating the elevated floor of the thoracic cavity. The inferior surface is concave, creating the curved roof of the abdominal cavity.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch11_04_02"><div data-type="title">Muscles of the Diaphragm </div><figcaption>The diaphragm separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id2969901" data-alt="This figure shows the inferior view of the diaphragm with the major parts labeled.">

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id2072110">Defecating, urination, and even childbirth involve cooperation between the diaphragm and abdominal muscles (this cooperation is referred to as the &#8220;Valsalva maneuver&#8221;). You hold your breath by a steady contraction of the diaphragm; this stabilizes the volume and pressure of the peritoneal cavity. When the abdominal muscles contract, the pressure cannot push the diaphragm up, so it increases pressure on the intestinal tract (defecation), urinary tract (urination), or reproductive tract (childbirth).</p>
<p id="fs-id2304478">The inferior surface of the pericardial sac and the inferior surfaces of the pleural membranes (parietal pleura) fuse onto the central tendon of the diaphragm. To the sides of the tendon are the skeletal muscle portions of the diaphragm, which insert into the tendon while having a number of origins including the xiphoid process of the sternum anteriorly, the inferior six ribs and their cartilages laterally, and the lumbar vertebrae and 12th ribs posteriorly.</p>
<p id="fs-id2143601">The diaphragm also includes three openings for the passage of structures between the thorax and the abdomen. The inferior vena cava passes through the <span data-type="term">caval opening</span>, and the esophagus and attached nerves pass through the esophageal hiatus. The aorta, thoracic duct, and azygous vein pass through the aortic hiatus of the posterior diaphragm.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2236969"><h4 data-type="title">The Intercostal Muscles</h4>
<p id="fs-id2494693">There are three sets of muscles, called <span data-type="term">intercostal muscles</span>, which span each of the intercostal spaces.

<p id="fs-id2723900">Made of skin, fascia, and four pairs of muscle, the anterior abdominal wall protects the organs located in the abdomen and moves the vertebral column. These muscles include the rectus abdominis, which extends through the entire length of the trunk, the external oblique, the internal oblique, and the transversus abdominus. The quadratus lumborum forms the posterior abdominal wall.</p>
<p id="fs-id2135747">The muscles of the thorax play a large role in breathing, especially the dome-shaped diaphragm. When it contracts and flattens, the volume inside the pleural cavities increases, which decreases the pressure within them. As a result, air will flow into the lungs. The external and internal intercostal muscles span the space between the ribs and help change the shape of the rib cage and the volume-pressure ratio inside the pleural cavities during inspiration and expiration.</p>
<p id="fs-id1421015">The perineum muscles play roles in urination in both sexes, ejaculation in men, and vaginal contraction in women. The pelvic floor muscles support the pelvic organs, resist intra-abdominal pressure, and work as sphincters for the urethra, rectum, and vagina.</p>
