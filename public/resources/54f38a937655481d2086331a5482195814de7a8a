<p id="fs-idp18381520">When some substances are dissolved in water, they undergo either a physical or a chemical change that yields ions in solution. These substances constitute an important class of compounds called <span data-type="term">electrolytes</span>. Substances that do not yield ions when dissolved are called <span data-type="term">nonelectrolytes</span>. If the physical or chemical process that generates the ions is essentially 100% efficient (all of the dissolved compound yields ions), then the substance is known as a <span data-type="term">strong electrolyte</span>. If only a relatively small fraction of the dissolved substance undergoes the ion-producing process, it is called a <span data-type="term">weak electrolyte</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-idm8509568">Substances may be identified as strong, weak, or nonelectrolytes by measuring the electrical conductance of an aqueous solution containing the substance. To conduct electricity, a substance must contain freely mobile, charged species. Most familiar is the conduction of electricity through metallic wires, in which case the mobile, charged entities are electrons. Solutions may also conduct electricity if they contain dissolved ions, with conductivity increasing as ion concentration increases. Applying a voltage to electrodes immersed in a solution permits assessment of the relative concentration of dissolved ions, either quantitatively, by measuring the electrical current flow, or qualitatively, by observing the brightness of a light bulb included in the circuit (<a href="#CNX_Chem_11_02_electrolyt" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_11_02_electrolyt"><figcaption>Solutions of nonelectrolytes such as ethanol do not contain dissolved ions and cannot conduct electricity. Solutions of electrolytes contain ions that permit the passage of electricity. The conductivity of an electrolyte solution is related to the strength of the electrolyte.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idp2501472">Water and other polar molecules are attracted to ions, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_11_02_waterions" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The electrostatic attraction between an ion and a molecule with a dipole is called an <span data-type="term">ion-dipole attraction</span>. These attractions play an important role in the dissolution of ionic compounds in water.</p>

<p id="fs-idp43584496">When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions in the solid separate and disperse uniformly throughout the solution because water molecules surround and solvate the ions, reducing the strong electrostatic forces between them. This process represents a physical change known as <span data-type="term">dissociation</span>. Under most conditions, ionic compounds will dissociate nearly completely when dissolved, and so they are classified as strong electrolytes. Even sparingly, soluble ionic compounds are strong electrolytes, since the small amount that does dissolve will dissociate completely.</p>
<p id="fs-idp39918704">Consider what happens at the microscopic level when solid KCl is added to water. Ion-dipole forces attract the positive (hydrogen) end of the polar water molecules to the negative chloride ions at the surface of the solid, and they attract the negative (oxygen) ends to the positive potassium ions. The water molecules surround individual K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> ions, reducing the strong interionic forces that bind the ions together and letting them move off into solution as solvated ions, as <a href="#CNX_Chem_11_02_waterions" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows. Overcoming the electrostatic attraction permits the independent motion of each hydrated ion in a dilute solution as the ions transition from fixed positions in the undissolved compound to widely dispersed, solvated ions in solution.</p>

<p id="fs-idm4855136">This reaction is essentially 100% complete for HCl (i.e., it is a <em data-effect="italics">strong acid</em> and, consequently, a strong electrolyte). Likewise, weak acids and bases that only react partially generate relatively low concentrations of ions when dissolved in water and are classified as weak electrolytes.

<p id="fs-idp18654544">Substances that dissolve in water to yield ions are called electrolytes. Electrolytes may be covalent compounds that chemically react with water to produce ions (for example, acids and bases), or they may be ionic compounds that dissociate to yield their constituent cations and anions, when dissolved. Dissolution of an ionic compound is facilitated by ion-dipole attractions between the ions of the compound and the polar water molecules. Soluble ionic substances and strong acids ionize completely and are strong electrolytes, while weak acids and bases ionize to only a small extent and are weak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes are substances that do not produce ions when dissolved in water.</p>
