<p id="fs-idm38786224">Thus far in this chapter, we have discussed the various types of bonds that form between atoms and/or ions. In all cases, these bonds involve the sharing or transfer of valence shell electrons between atoms. In this section, we will explore the typical method for depicting valence shell electrons and chemical bonds, namely Lewis symbols and Lewis structures.</p>

<p id="fs-idm97531888">A single shared pair of electrons is called a <span data-type="term">single bond</span>. Each Cl atom interacts with eight valence electrons: the six in the lone pairs and the two in the single bond.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idp113967376"><h4 data-type="title">The Octet Rule</h4>
<p id="fs-idm16266560">The other halogen molecules (F<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, and At<sub>2</sub>) form bonds like those in the chlorine molecule: one single bond between atoms and three lone pairs of electrons per atom. This allows each halogen atom to have a noble gas electron configuration. The tendency of main group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons is known as the <span data-type="term">octet rule</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-idm45369344">The number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table (C, N, O, and F). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as illustrated here for carbon in CCl<sub>4</sub> (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon in SiH<sub>4</sub> (silane). Because hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, it is an exception to the octet rule. The transition elements and inner transition elements also do not follow the octet rule:</p>

<p id="fs-idm49249888">For more complicated molecules and molecular ions, it is helpful to follow the step-by-step procedure outlined here:</p>
<ol id="fs-idp55317056" type="1">
<li>Determine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons. For cations, subtract one electron for each positive charge. For anions, add one electron for each negative charge.</li>
<li>Draw a skeleton structure of the molecule or ion, arranging the atoms around a central atom. (Generally, the least electronegative element should be placed in the center.) Connect each atom to the central atom with a single bond (one electron pair).</li>
<li>Distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs on the terminal atoms (except hydrogen), completing an octet around each atom.</li>
<li>Place all remaining electrons on the central atom.</li>

<p id="fs-idm51238992">To draw the Lewis structure for an odd-electron molecule like NO, we follow the same five steps we would for other molecules, but with a few minor changes:</p><ol id="fs-idp52495568" type="1">
<li><em data-effect="italics">Determine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons</em>. The sum of the valence electrons is 5 (from N) + 6 (from O) = 11.

<p id="fs-idm12065312">We will also encounter a few molecules that contain central atoms that do not have a filled valence shell. Generally, these are molecules with central atoms from groups 2 and 13, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or other atoms that do not form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium dihydride, BeH<sub>2</sub>, and boron trifluoride, BF<sub>3</sub>, the beryllium and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons, respectively. It is possible to draw a structure with a double bond between a boron atom and a fluorine atom in BF<sub>3</sub>, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected for B&#8211;F single bonds. This suggests the best Lewis structure has three B&#8211;F single bonds and an electron deficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with an electron deficient boron. However, the B&#8211;F bonds are slightly shorter than what is actually expected for B&#8211;F single bonds, indicating that some double bond character is found in the actual molecule.</p><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm19104608" data-alt="Two Lewis structures are shown.

<p id="fs-idm18966656">Valence electronic structures can be visualized by drawing Lewis symbols (for atoms and monatomic ions) and Lewis structures (for molecules and polyatomic ions). Lone pairs, unpaired electrons, and single, double, or triple bonds are used to indicate where the valence electrons are located around each atom in a Lewis structure. Most structures&#8212;especially those containing second row elements&#8212;obey the octet rule, in which every atom (except H) is surrounded by eight electrons. Exceptions to the octet rule occur for odd-electron molecules (free radicals), electron-deficient molecules, and hypervalent molecules.</p>
