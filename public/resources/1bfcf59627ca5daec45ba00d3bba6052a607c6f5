<p id="fs-idp29962352">The importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol&#8212;for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbon-oxygen bond. The reverse reaction&#8212;replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond&#8212;is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a &#8211;2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of C&#8211;O and C&#8211;H bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:</p>

<p id="fs-idp26912672">What are the oxidation numbers for the carbon atoms in the molecules shown here?</p>
<p id="fs-idp48045920"><span data-type="title">Solution</span>
In this example, we can calculate the oxidation number (review the chapter on oxidation-reduction reactions if necessary) for the carbon atom in each case (note how this would become difficult for larger molecules with additional carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms, which is why organic chemists use the definition dealing with replacing C&#8211;H bonds with C&#8211;O bonds described). For CH<sub>4</sub>, the carbon atom carries a &#8211;4 oxidation number (the hydrogen atoms are assigned oxidation numbers of +1 and the carbon atom balances that by having an oxidation number of &#8211;4). For the alcohol (in this case, methanol), the carbon atom has an oxidation number of &#8211;2 (the oxygen atom is assigned &#8211;2, the four hydrogen atoms each are assigned +1, and the carbon atom balances the sum by having an oxidation number of &#8211;2; note that compared to the carbon atom in CH<sub>4</sub>, this carbon atom has lost two electrons so it was oxidized); for the aldehyde, the carbon atom&#8217;s oxidation number is 0 (&#8211;2 for the oxygen atom and +1 for each hydrogen atom already balances to 0, so the oxidation number for the carbon atom is 0); for the carboxylic acid, the carbon atom&#8217;s oxidation number is +2 (two oxygen atoms each at &#8211;2 and two hydrogen atoms at +1); and for carbon dioxide, the carbon atom&#8217;s oxidation number is +4 (here, the carbon atom needs to balance the &#8211;4 sum from the two oxygen atoms).</p>

It is sold in an aqueous solution called formalin, which contains about 37% formaldehyde by weight. Formaldehyde causes coagulation of proteins, so it kills bacteria (and any other living organism) and stops many of the biological processes that cause tissue to decay. Thus, formaldehyde is used for preserving tissue specimens and embalming bodies. It is also used to sterilize soil or other materials. Formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of Bakelite, a hard plastic having high chemical and electrical resistance.</p>

Among its many uses are as a solvent for lacquer (including fingernail polish), cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, acetylene, plastics, and varnishes; as a paint and varnish remover; and as a solvent in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and chemicals.</p>

<p id="fs-idp6338256">Functional groups related to the carbonyl group include the &#8211;CHO group of an aldehyde, the &#8211;CO&#8211; group of a ketone, the &#8211;CO<sub>2</sub>H group of a carboxylic acid, and the &#8211;CO<sub>2</sub>R group of an ester. The carbonyl group, a carbon-oxygen double bond, is the key structure in these classes of organic molecules: Aldehydes contain at least one hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon atom, ketones contain two carbon groups attached to the carbonyl carbon atom, carboxylic acids contain a hydroxyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon atom, and esters contain an oxygen atom attached to another carbon group connected to the carbonyl carbon atom. All of these compounds contain oxidized carbon atoms relative to the carbon atom of an alcohol group.</p>
