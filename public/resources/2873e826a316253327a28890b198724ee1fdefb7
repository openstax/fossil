<para id="fs-idp120146608">The hemoglobin in your blood, the chlorophyll in green plants, vitamin B-12, and the catalyst used in the manufacture of polyethylene all contain coordination compounds. Ions of the metals, especially the transition metals, are likely to form complexes. Many of these compounds are highly colored (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_19_02_Colors"/>). In the remainder of this chapter, we will consider the structure and bonding of these remarkable compounds.</para>

<para id="fs-idp92015616">Remember that in most main group element compounds, the valence electrons of the isolated atoms combine to form chemical bonds that satisfy the octet rule. For instance, the four valence electrons of carbon overlap with electrons from four hydrogen atoms to form CH<sub>4</sub>. The one valence electron leaves sodium and adds to the seven valence electrons of chlorine to form the ionic formula unit NaCl (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_19_02_BondType"/>). Transition metals do not normally bond in this fashion. They primarily form coordinate covalent bonds, a form of the Lewis acid-base interaction in which both of the electrons in the bond are contributed by a donor (Lewis base) to an electron acceptor (Lewis acid). The Lewis acid in coordination complexes, often called a <term>central metal</term> ion (or atom), is often a transition metal or inner transition metal, although main group elements can also form <term>coordination compounds</term>. The Lewis base donors, called <term>ligands</term>, can be a wide variety of chemicals—atoms, molecules, or ions. The only requirement is that they have one or more electron pairs, which can be donated to the central metal. Most often, this involves a <term>donor atom</term> with a lone pair of electrons that can form a coordinate bond to the metal.</para>

<para id="fs-idp151225552">The <term>coordination sphere</term> consists of the central metal ion or atom plus its attached ligands. Brackets in a formula enclose the coordination sphere; species outside the brackets are not part of the coordination sphere.

The coordination number for the silver ion in [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> is two (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_19_02_CN"/>). For the copper(II) ion in [CuCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2−</sup>, the coordination number is four, whereas for the cobalt(II) ion in [Co(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> the coordination number is six. Each of these ligands is <term>monodentate</term>, from the Greek for “one toothed,” meaning that they connect with the central metal through only one atom.

<para id="fs-idp37282080">Many other ligands coordinate to the metal in more complex fashions. <term>Bidentate ligands</term> are those in which two atoms coordinate to the metal center.

Both of the atoms can coordinate to a single metal center. In the complex [Co(en)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>, there are three bidentate en ligands, and the coordination number of the cobalt(III) ion is six.

<para id="fs-idp32736688">Any ligand that bonds to a central metal ion by more than one donor atom is a <term>polydentate ligand</term> (or “many teeth”) because it can bite into the metal center with more than one bond. The term <term>chelate</term> (pronounced “KEY-late”) from the Greek for “claw” is also used to describe this type of interaction. Many polydentate ligands are <term>chelating ligands</term>, and a complex consisting of one or more of these ligands and a central metal is a chelate. A chelating ligand is also known as a chelating agent. A chelating ligand holds the metal ion rather like a crab’s claw would hold a marble. <link target-id="CNX_Chem_19_02_en"/> showed one example of a chelate. The heme complex in hemoglobin is another important example (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_19_02_heme"/>). It contains a polydentate ligand with four donor atoms that coordinate to iron.</para>

<title>The Naming of Complexes</title>
<para id="fs-idp51192128">The nomenclature of the complexes is patterned after a system suggested by Alfred Werner, a Swiss chemist and Nobel laureate, whose outstanding work more than 100 years ago laid the foundation for a clearer understanding of these compounds. The following five rules are used for naming complexes:</para>

<item>Name the ligands first, followed by the central metal. Name the ligands alphabetically. Negative ligands (anions) have names formed by adding -<emphasis effect="italics">o</emphasis> to the stem name of the group. For examples, see <link target-id="fs-idp115554880"/>. For most neutral ligands, the name of the molecule is used. The four common exceptions are <emphasis effect="italics">aqua</emphasis> (H<sub>2</sub>O), <emphasis effect="italics">ammine</emphasis> (NH<sub>3</sub>), <emphasis effect="italics">carbonyl</emphasis> (CO), and <emphasis effect="italics">nitrosyl</emphasis> (NO).

For example, the ion bis(bipyridyl)osmium(II) uses bis- to signify that there are two ligands attached to Os, and each bipyridyl ligand contains two pyridine groups (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N).</item>
</list><para id="fs-idp261455600">When the complex is either a cation or a neutral molecule, the name of the central metal atom is spelled exactly like the name of the element and is followed by a Roman numeral in parentheses to indicate its oxidation state (<link target-id="fs-idp99540896"/> and <link target-id="fs-idp97436016"/>). When the complex is an anion, the suffix -ate is added to the stem of the name of the metal, followed by the Roman numeral designation of its oxidation state (<link target-id="fs-idp240256816"/>).

The oxidation state of the metal is determined based on the charges of each ligand and the overall charge of the coordination compound. For example, in [Cr(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]Br, the coordination sphere (in brackets) has a charge of 1+ to balance the bromide ion. The water ligands are neutral, and the chloride ligands are anionic with a charge of 1− each. To determine the oxidation state of the metal, we set the overall charge equal to the sum of the ligands and the metal: +1 = −2 + <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>, so the oxidation state (<emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>) is equal to 3+.</para>

<para id="fs-idp18845840">Another important type of isomers are <term>optical isomers</term>, or <term>enantiomers</term>, in which two objects are exact mirror images of each other but cannot be lined up so that all parts match. This means that optical isomers are nonsuperimposable mirror images. A classic example of this is a pair of hands, in which the right and left hand are mirror images of one another but cannot be superimposed. Optical isomers are very important in organic and biochemistry because living systems often incorporate one specific optical isomer and not the other. Unlike geometric isomers, pairs of optical isomers have identical properties (boiling point, polarity, solubility, etc.). Optical isomers differ only in the way they affect polarized light and how they react with other optical isomers. For coordination complexes, many coordination compounds such as [M(en)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>n+</sup> [in which M<sup>n+</sup> is a central metal ion such as iron(III) or cobalt(II)] form enantiomers, as shown in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_19_02_enant"/>.

<title>Transition Metal Catalysts</title>
<para id="fs-idp55376000">One of the most important applications of transition metals is as industrial catalysts. As you recall from the chapter on kinetics, a catalyst increases the rate of reaction by lowering the activation energy and is regenerated in the catalytic cycle. Over 90% of all manufactured products are made with the aid of one or more catalysts. The ability to bind ligands and change oxidation states makes transition metal catalysts well suited for catalytic applications. Vanadium oxide is used to produce 230,000,000 tons of sulfuric acid worldwide each year, which in turn is used to make everything from fertilizers to cans for food. Plastics are made with the aid of transition metal catalysts, along with detergents, fertilizers, paints, and more (see <link target-id="CNX_Chem_19_02_Cat"/>). Very complicated pharmaceuticals are manufactured with catalysts that are selective, reacting with one specific bond out of a large number of possibilities. Catalysts allow processes to be more economical and more environmentally friendly. Developing new catalysts and better understanding of existing systems are important areas of current research.</para>
