<p id="fs-id1857113">Organic compounds typically consist of groups of carbon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen, usually oxygen, and often other elements as well. Created by living things, they are found throughout the world, in soils and seas, commercial products, and every cell of the human body. The four types most important to human structure and function are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleotides. Before exploring these compounds, you need to first understand the chemistry of carbon.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1243123"><h3 data-type="title">The Chemistry of Carbon</h3>
<p id="fs-id2413719">What makes organic compounds ubiquitous is the chemistry of their carbon core. Recall that carbon atoms have four electrons in their valence shell, and that the octet rule dictates that atoms tend to react in such a way as to complete their valence shell with eight electrons. Carbon atoms do not complete their valence shells by donating or accepting four electrons. Instead, they readily share electrons via covalent bonds.</p>
<p id="fs-id2338170">Commonly, carbon atoms share with other carbon atoms, often forming a long carbon chain referred to as a carbon skeleton. When they do share, however, they do not share all their electrons exclusively with each other. Rather, carbon atoms tend to share electrons with a variety of other elements, one of which is always hydrogen. Carbon and hydrogen groupings are called hydrocarbons. If you study the figures of organic compounds in the remainder of this chapter, you will see several with chains of hydrocarbons in one region of the compound.</p>
<p id="fs-id2069935">Many combinations are possible to fill carbon&#8217;s four &#8220;vacancies.&#8221; Carbon may share electrons with oxygen or nitrogen or other atoms in a particular region of an organic compound. Moreover, the atoms to which carbon atoms bond may also be part of a functional group. A <span data-type="term">functional group</span> is a group of atoms linked by strong covalent bonds and tending to function in chemical reactions as a single unit. You can think of functional groups as tightly knit &#8220;cliques&#8221; whose members are unlikely to be parted. Five functional groups are important in human physiology; these are the hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, methyl and phosphate groups (<a href="#tbl-ch02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-id1383422">Carbon&#8217;s affinity for covalent bonding means that many distinct and relatively stable organic molecules nevertheless readily form larger, more complex molecules. Any large molecule is referred to as <span data-type="term">macromolecule</span> (macro- = &#8220;large&#8221;), and the organic compounds in this section all fit this description. However, some macromolecules are made up of several &#8220;copies&#8221; of single units called monomer (mono- = &#8220;one&#8221;; -mer = &#8220;part&#8221;). Like beads in a long necklace, these monomers link by covalent bonds to form long polymers (poly- = &#8220;many&#8221;). There are many examples of monomers and polymers among the organic compounds.</p>
<p id="fs-id2664476">Monomers form polymers by engaging in dehydration synthesis (see <a href="/contents/e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1#fig-ch02_04_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). As was noted earlier, this reaction results in the release of a molecule of water. Each monomer contributes: One gives up a hydrogen atom and the other gives up a hydroxyl group. Polymers are split into monomers by hydrolysis (-lysis = &#8220;rupture&#8221;). The bonds between their monomers are broken, via the donation of a molecule of water, which contributes a hydrogen atom to one monomer and a hydroxyl group to the other.</p></section>

<p id="fs-id2160830">The term carbohydrate means &#8220;hydrated carbon.&#8221; Recall that the root hydro- indicates water. A <span data-type="term">carbohydrate</span> is a molecule composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; in most carbohydrates, hydrogen and oxygen are found in the same two-to-one relative proportions they have in water. In fact, the chemical formula for a &#8220;generic&#8221; molecule of carbohydrate is (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<em data-effect="italics"><sub>n</sub></em>.</p>
<p id="fs-id2371267">Carbohydrates are referred to as saccharides, a word meaning &#8220;sugars.&#8221; Three forms are important in the body. Monosaccharides are the monomers of carbohydrates. Disaccharides (di- = &#8220;two&#8221;) are made up of two monomers. <span data-type="term">Polysaccharides</span> are the polymers, and can consist of hundreds to thousands of monomers.</p>

<p id="fs-id1363592">A <span data-type="term">disaccharide</span> is a pair of monosaccharides. Disaccharides are formed via dehydration synthesis, and the bond linking them is referred to as a glycosidic bond (glyco- = &#8220;sugar&#8221;). Three disaccharides (shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_05_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) are important to humans. These are sucrose, commonly referred to as table sugar; lactose, or milk sugar; and maltose, or malt sugar. As you can tell from their common names, you consume these in your diet; however, your body cannot use them directly. Instead, in the digestive tract, they are split into their component monosaccharides via hydrolysis.</p>

<ul id="fs-id1401240"><li>Starches are polymers of glucose. They occur in long chains called amylose or branched chains called amylopectin, both of which are stored in plant-based foods and are relatively easy to digest.</li>
<li>Glycogen is also a polymer of glucose, but it is stored in the tissues of animals, especially in the muscles and liver. It is not considered a dietary carbohydrate because very little glycogen remains in animal tissues after slaughter; however, the human body stores excess glucose as glycogen, again, in the muscles and liver.</li>
<li>Cellulose, a polysaccharide that is the primary component of the cell wall of green plants, is the component of plant food referred to as &#8220;fiber&#8221;. In humans, cellulose/fiber is not digestible; however, dietary fiber has many health benefits. It helps you feel full so you eat less, it promotes a healthy digestive tract, and a diet high in fiber is thought to reduce the risk of heart disease and possibly some forms of cancer.</li>

<p id="fs-id1915226">The body obtains carbohydrates from plant-based foods. Grains, fruits, and legumes and other vegetables provide most of the carbohydrate in the human diet, although lactose is found in dairy products.</p>
<p id="fs-id1406008">Although most body cells can break down other organic compounds for fuel, all body cells can use glucose. Moreover, nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, spinal cord, and through the peripheral nervous system, as well as red blood cells, can use only glucose for fuel. In the breakdown of glucose for energy, molecules of adenosine triphosphate, better known as ATP, are produced. <span data-type="term">Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)</span> is composed of a ribose sugar, an adenine base, and three phosphate groups. ATP releases free energy when its phosphate bonds are broken, and thus supplies ready energy to the cell. More ATP is produced in the presence of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) than in pathways that do not use oxygen. The overall reaction for the conversion of the energy in glucose to energy stored in ATP can be written:</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2156517"><h3 data-type="title">Lipids</h3>
<p id="fs-id1639379">A <span data-type="term">lipid</span> is one of a highly diverse group of compounds made up mostly of hydrocarbons. The few oxygen atoms they contain are often at the periphery of the molecule. Their nonpolar hydrocarbons make all lipids hydrophobic. In water, lipids do not form a true solution, but they may form an emulsion, which is the term for a mixture of solutions that do not mix well.</p><section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2070381"><h4 data-type="title">Triglycerides</h4>
<p id="fs-id1386190">A <span data-type="term">triglyceride</span> is one of the most common dietary lipid groups, and the type found most abundantly in body tissues. This compound, which is commonly referred to as a fat, is formed from the synthesis of two types of molecules (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>):</p>
<ul id="fs-id1335764">
<li>A glycerol backbone at the core of triglycerides, consists of three carbon atoms.</li>
<li>Three fatty acids, long chains of hydrocarbons with a carboxyl group and a methyl group at opposite ends, extend from each of the carbons of the glycerol.</li></ul>
<figure id="fig-ch02_05_04"><div data-type="title">Triglycerides </div><figcaption>Triglycerides are composed of glycerol attached to three fatty acids via dehydration synthesis. Notice that glycerol gives up a hydrogen atom, and the carboxyl groups on the fatty acids each give up a hydroxyl group.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id2169041" data-alt="This image shows the reaction for the formation of triglycerides.">

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id2789686">Triglycerides form via dehydration synthesis. Glycerol gives up hydrogen atoms from its hydroxyl groups at each bond, and the carboxyl group on each fatty acid chain gives up a hydroxyl group. A total of three water molecules are thereby released.</p>
<p id="fs-id2204630">Fatty acid chains that have no double carbon bonds anywhere along their length and therefore contain the maximum number of hydrogen atoms are called saturated fatty acids. These straight, rigid chains pack tightly together and are solid or semi-solid at room temperature (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">a</strong>). Butter and lard are examples, as is the fat found on a steak or in your own body. In contrast, fatty acids with one double carbon bond are kinked at that bond (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">b</strong>). These monounsaturated fatty acids are therefore unable to pack together tightly, and are liquid at room temperature. Polyunsaturated fatty acids contain two or more double carbon bonds, and are also liquid at room temperature. Plant oils such as olive oil typically contain both mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id2122578">Whereas a diet high in saturated fatty acids increases the risk of heart disease, a diet high in unsaturated fatty acids is thought to reduce the risk. This is especially true for the omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids found in cold-water fish such as salmon. These fatty acids have their first double carbon bond at the third hydrocarbon from the methyl group (referred to as the omega end of the molecule).</p>
<p id="fs-id805451">Finally, <em data-effect="italics">trans</em> fatty acids found in some processed foods, including some stick and tub margarines, are thought to be even more harmful to the heart and blood vessels than saturated fatty acids. <em data-effect="italics">Trans</em> fats are created from unsaturated fatty acids (such as corn oil) when chemically treated to produce partially hydrogenated fats.</p>
<p id="fs-id2339167">As a group, triglycerides are a major fuel source for the body. When you are resting or asleep, a majority of the energy used to keep you alive is derived from triglycerides stored in your fat (adipose) tissues. Triglycerides also fuel long, slow physical activity such as gardening or hiking, and contribute a modest percentage of energy for vigorous physical activity. Dietary fat also assists the absorption and transport of the nonpolar fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Additionally, stored body fat protects and cushions the body&#8217;s bones and internal organs, and acts as insulation to retain body heat.</p>
<p id="fs-id2181771">Fatty acids are also components of glycolipids, which are sugar-fat compounds found in the cell membrane. Lipoproteins are compounds in which the hydrophobic triglycerides are packaged in protein envelopes for transport in body fluids.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2134566"><h4 data-type="title">Phospholipids</h4>
<p id="fs-id1956733">As its name suggests, a <span data-type="term">phospholipid</span> is a bond between the glycerol component of a lipid and a phosphorous molecule. In fact, phospholipids are similar in structure to triglycerides. However, instead of having three fatty acids, a phospholipid is generated from a diglyceride, a glycerol with just two fatty acid chains (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The third binding site on the glycerol is taken up by the phosphate group, which in turn is attached to a polar &#8220;head&#8221; region of the molecule. Recall that triglycerides are nonpolar and hydrophobic. This still holds for the fatty acid portion of a phospholipid compound. However, the head of a phospholipid contains charges on the phosphate groups, as well as on the nitrogen atom. These charges make the phospholipid head hydrophilic. Therefore, phospholipids are said to have hydrophobic tails, containing the neutral fatty acids, and hydrophilic heads, containing the charged phosphate groups and nitrogen atom.</p><figure id="fig-ch02_05_06"><div data-type="title">Other Important Lipids </div><figcaption>(a) Phospholipids are composed of two fatty acids, glycerol, and a phosphate group.

<p id="fs-id1472124">A <span data-type="term">steroid</span> compound (referred to as a sterol) has as its foundation a set of four hydrocarbon rings bonded to a variety of other atoms and molecules (see <a href="#fig-ch02_05_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">b</strong>). Although both plants and animals synthesize sterols, the type that makes the most important contribution to human structure and function is cholesterol, which is synthesized by the liver in humans and animals and is also present in most animal-based foods. Like other lipids, cholesterol&#8217;s hydrocarbons make it hydrophobic; however, it has a polar hydroxyl head that is hydrophilic. Cholesterol is an important component of bile acids, compounds that help emulsify dietary fats. In fact, the word root chole- refers to bile. Cholesterol is also a building block of many hormones, signaling molecules that the body releases to regulate processes at distant sites. Finally, like phospholipids, cholesterol molecules are found in the cell membrane, where their hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions help regulate the flow of substances into and out of the cell.</p></section>

<p id="fs-id2263987">Like a hormone, a <span data-type="term">prostaglandin</span> is one of a group of signaling molecules, but prostaglandins are derived from unsaturated fatty acids (see <a href="#fig-ch02_05_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">c</strong>). One reason that the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are beneficial is that they stimulate the production of certain prostaglandins that help regulate aspects of blood pressure and inflammation, and thereby reduce the risk for heart disease. Prostaglandins also sensitize nerves to pain. One class of pain-relieving medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) works by reducing the effects of prostaglandins.</p>

<p id="fs-id2271940">You might associate proteins with muscle tissue, but in fact, proteins are critical components of all tissues and organs. A <span data-type="term">protein</span> is an organic molecule composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Proteins include the keratin in the epidermis of skin that protects underlying tissues, the collagen found in the dermis of skin, in bones, and in the meninges that cover the brain and spinal cord. Proteins are also components of many of the body&#8217;s functional chemicals, including digestive enzymes in the digestive tract, antibodies, the neurotransmitters that neurons use to communicate with other cells, and the peptide-based hormones that regulate certain body functions (for instance, growth hormone). While carbohydrates and lipids are composed of hydrocarbons and oxygen, all proteins also contain nitrogen (N), and many contain sulfur (S), in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2102448"><h4 data-type="title">Microstructure of Proteins</h4>
<p id="fs-id2151470">Proteins are polymers made up of nitrogen-containing monomers called amino acids. An <span data-type="term">amino acid</span> is a molecule composed of an amino group and a carboxyl group, together with a variable side chain. Just 20 different amino acids contribute to nearly all of the thousands of different proteins important in human structure and function.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id1698290">Notice that all amino acids contain both an acid (the carboxyl group) and a base (the amino group) (amine = &#8220;nitrogen-containing&#8221;). For this reason, they make excellent buffers, helping the body regulate acid&#8211;base balance. What distinguishes the 20 amino acids from one another is their variable group, which is referred to as a side chain or an R-group. This group can vary in size and can be polar or nonpolar, giving each amino acid its unique characteristics. For example, the side chains of two amino acids&#8212;cysteine and methionine&#8212;contain sulfur. Sulfur does not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way that proteins containing cysteine and methionine are assembled.</p>
<p id="fs-id1700797">Amino acids join via dehydration synthesis to form protein polymers (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The unique bond holding amino acids together is called a peptide bond. A <span data-type="term">peptide bond</span> is a covalent bond between two amino acids that forms by dehydration synthesis. A peptide, in fact, is a very short chain of amino acids. Strands containing fewer than about 100 amino acids are generally referred to as polypeptides rather than proteins.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-id1891348">The body is able to synthesize most of the amino acids from components of other molecules; however, nine cannot be synthesized and have to be consumed in the diet. These are known as the essential amino acids.</p>
<p id="fs-id2143872">Free amino acids available for protein construction are said to reside in the amino acid pool within cells. Structures within cells use these amino acids when assembling proteins. If a particular essential amino acid is not available in sufficient quantities in the amino acid pool, however, synthesis of proteins containing it can slow or even cease.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2344664"><h4 data-type="title">Shape of Proteins</h4>
<p id="fs-id1470071">Just as a fork cannot be used to eat soup and a spoon cannot be used to spear meat, a protein&#8217;s shape is essential to its function. A protein&#8217;s shape is determined, most fundamentally, by the sequence of amino acids of which it is made (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">a</strong>). The sequence is called the primary structure of the protein.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_05_09"><div data-type="title">The Shape of Proteins </div><figcaption>(a) The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain. (b) The secondary structure, which can take the form of an alpha-helix or a beta-pleated sheet, is maintained by hydrogen bonds between amino acids in different regions of the original polypeptide strand. (c) The tertiary structure occurs as a result of further folding and bonding of the secondary structure. (d) The quaternary structure occurs as a result of interactions between two or more tertiary subunits. The example shown here is hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells which transports oxygen to body tissues.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id2623329" data-alt="This figure shows the secondary structure of peptides.

The top panel shows a straight chain, the middle panel shows an alpha-helix and a beta sheet. The bottom panel shows the tertiary structure and fully folded protein." width="480"/>
</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id2242372">Although some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary structures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the polypeptide. The most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. If you were to take a length of string and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see <a href="#fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">b</strong>). Less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains.</p>
<p id="fs-id1707170">The secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the protein&#8217;s tertiary structure (see <a href="#fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">c</strong>). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. A <span data-type="term">disulfide bond</span> is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see <a href="#fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">d</strong>). The polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. For instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains.</p><p id="fs-id1840952">When they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature. <span data-type="term">Denaturation</span> is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. Denatured proteins lose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. An everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added.</p>
<p id="fs-id2625066">The contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. For example, the long, slender shape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax (lengthen). As another example, bones contain long threads of a protein called collagen that acts as scaffolding upon which bone minerals are deposited. These elongated proteins, called fibrous proteins, are strong and durable and typically hydrophobic.</p>
<p id="fs-id1383766">In contrast, globular proteins are globes or spheres that tend to be highly reactive and are hydrophilic. The hemoglobin proteins packed into red blood cells are an example (see <a href="#fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">d</strong>); however, globular proteins are abundant throughout the body, playing critical roles in most body functions. Enzymes, introduced earlier as protein catalysts, are examples of this. The next section takes a closer look at the action of enzymes.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2350637"><h4 data-type="title">Proteins Function as Enzymes</h4>
<p id="fs-id2591372">If you were trying to type a paper, and every time you hit a key on your laptop there was a delay of six or seven minutes before you got a response, you would probably get a new laptop. In a similar way, without enzymes to catalyze chemical reactions, the human body would be nonfunctional. It functions only because enzymes function.</p>
<p id="fs-id1861297">Enzymatic reactions&#8212;chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes&#8212;begin when substrates bind to the enzyme. A <span data-type="term">substrate</span> is a reactant in an enzymatic reaction. This occurs on regions of the enzyme known as active sites (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_10" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Any given enzyme catalyzes just one type of chemical reaction. This characteristic, called specificity, is due to the fact that a substrate with a particular shape and electrical charge can bind only to an active site corresponding to that substrate.</p>
<p id="eip-0">Due to this jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates, enzymes are known for their specificity. In fact, as an enzyme binds to its substrate(s), the enzyme structure changes slightly to find the best fit between the transition state (a structural intermediate between the substrate and product) and the active site, just as a rubber glove molds to a hand inserted into it. This active-site modification in the presence of substrate, along with the simultaneous formation of the transition state, is called induced fit. Overall, there is a specifically matched enzyme for each substrate and, thus, for each chemical reaction; however, there is some flexibility as well. Some enzymes have the ability to act on several different structurally related substrates.</p><figure id="fig-ch02_05_10"><div data-type="title">Steps in an Enzymatic Reaction </div><figcaption>According to the induced-fit model, the active site of the enzyme undergoes conformational changes upon binding with the substrate.(a) Substrates approach active sites on enzyme. (b) Substrates bind to active sites, producing an enzyme&#8211;substrate complex. (c) Changes internal to the enzyme&#8211;substrate complex facilitate interaction of the substrates. (d) Products are released and the enzyme returns to its original form, ready to facilitate another enzymatic reaction.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id2018261" data-alt="This image shows the steps in which an enzyme can act. The substrate is shown binding to the enzyme, forming a product, and the detachment of the product.">

The substrate is shown binding to the enzyme, forming a product, and the detachment of the product." width="520"/>
</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id1645297">Binding of a substrate produces an enzyme&#8211;substrate complex. It is likely that enzymes speed up chemical reactions in part because the enzyme&#8211;substrate complex undergoes a set of temporary and reversible changes that cause the substrates to be oriented toward each other in an optimal position to facilitate their interaction. This promotes increased reaction speed. The enzyme then releases the product(s), and resumes its original shape. The enzyme is then free to engage in the process again, and will do so as long as substrate remains.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1384993"><h4 data-type="title">Other Functions of Proteins</h4>
<p id="fs-id2370050">Advertisements for protein bars, powders, and shakes all say that protein is important in building, repairing, and maintaining muscle tissue, but the truth is that proteins contribute to all body tissues, from the skin to the brain cells. Also, certain proteins act as hormones, chemical messengers that help regulate body functions, For example, growth hormone is important for skeletal growth, among other roles.</p><p id="fs-id2154528">As was noted earlier, the basic and acidic components enable proteins to function as buffers in maintaining acid&#8211;base balance, but they also help regulate fluid&#8211;electrolyte balance. Proteins attract fluid, and a healthy concentration of proteins in the blood, the cells, and the spaces between cells helps ensure a balance of fluids in these various &#8220;compartments.&#8221; Moreover, proteins in the cell membrane help to transport electrolytes in and out of the cell, keeping these ions in a healthy balance. Like lipids, proteins can bind with carbohydrates. They can thereby produce glycoproteins or proteoglycans, both of which have many functions in the body.</p>
<p id="fs-id2070161">The body can use proteins for energy when carbohydrate and fat intake is inadequate, and stores of glycogen and adipose tissue become depleted. However, since there is no storage site for protein except functional tissues, using protein for energy causes tissue breakdown, and results in body wasting.</p>

<p id="fs-id2102405">The nucleic acids differ in their type of pentose sugar. <span data-type="term">Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</span> is nucleotide that stores genetic information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus one phosphate group and one nitrogen-containing base. The &#8220;choices&#8221; of base for DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. <span data-type="term">Ribonucleic acid (RNA)</span> is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic code as protein.

A <span data-type="term">purine</span> is a nitrogen-containing molecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine (found in DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. A <span data-type="term">pyramidine</span> is a nitrogen-containing base with a single ring structure</p>
<p id="fs-id2250840">Bonds formed by dehydration synthesis between the pentose sugar of one nucleic acid monomer and the phosphate group of another form a &#8220;backbone,&#8221; from which the components&#8217; nitrogen-containing bases protrude. In DNA, two such backbones attach at their protruding bases via hydrogen bonds. These twist to form a shape known as a double helix (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_12" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that act as a molecular code instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000 genes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which lose their nuclei during development). These genes carry the genetic code to build one&#8217;s body, and are unique for each individual except identical twins.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1861239" class="summary"><h3 data-type="title">Chapter Review</h3>
<p id="fs-id1865776">Organic compounds essential to human functioning include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic because they contain both carbon and hydrogen. Carbon atoms in organic compounds readily share electrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually oxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also may bond with one or more functional groups such as carboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates. Monomers are single units of organic compounds. They bond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which can in turn be broken by hydrolysis.</p>
<p id="fs-id2347482">Carbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel. Their structural forms include monosaccharides such as glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and polysaccharides, including starches (polymers of glucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and fiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel. It is converted via an oxidation-reduction reaction to ATP.</p>
<p id="fs-id1645046">Lipids are hydrophobic compounds that provide body fuel and are important components of many biological compounds. Triglycerides are the most abundant lipid in the body, and are composed of a glycerol backbone attached to three fatty acid chains. Phospholipids are compounds composed of a diglyceride with a phosphate group attached at the molecule&#8217;s head. The result is a molecule with polar and nonpolar regions. Steroids are lipids formed of four hydrocarbon rings. The most important is cholesterol. Prostaglandins are signaling molecules derived from unsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p id="fs-id2336120">Proteins are critical components of all body tissues. They are made up of monomers called amino acids, which contain nitrogen, joined by peptide bonds. Protein shape is critical to its function. Most body proteins are globular. An example is enzymes, which catalyze chemical reactions.</p>
<p id="fs-id2450246">Nucleotides are compounds with three building blocks: one or more phosphate groups, a pentose sugar, and a nitrogen-containing base. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids that function in protein synthesis. ATP is the body&#8217;s fundamental molecule of energy transfer. Removal or addition of phosphates releases or invests energy.</p>
