<para id="fs-idp41557488">The largest database<footnote id="fs-idp69619904">This is the Beilstein database, now available through the Reaxys site (www.elsevier.com/online-tools/reaxys).</footnote> of organic compounds lists about 10 million substances, which include compounds originating from living organisms and those synthesized by chemists. The number of potential organic compounds has been estimated<footnote id="fs-idp41278192">Peplow, Mark. “Organic Synthesis: The Robo-Chemist,” <emphasis effect="italics">Nature</emphasis> 512 (2014): 20–2.</footnote> at 10<sup>60</sup>—an astronomically high number. The existence of so many organic molecules is a consequence of the ability of carbon atoms to form up to four strong bonds to other carbon atoms, resulting in chains and rings of many different sizes, shapes, and complexities.</para>
<para id="fs-idp68083216">The simplest <term>organic compounds</term> contain only the elements carbon and hydrogen, and are called hydrocarbons. Even though they are composed of only two types of atoms, there is a wide variety of hydrocarbons because they may consist of varying lengths of chains, branched chains, and rings of carbon atoms, or combinations of these structures. In addition, hydrocarbons may differ in the types of carbon-carbon bonds present in their molecules. Many hydrocarbons are found in plants, animals, and their fossils; other hydrocarbons have been prepared in the laboratory. We use hydrocarbons every day, mainly as fuels, such as natural gas, acetylene, propane, butane, and the principal components of gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil. The familiar plastics polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene are also hydrocarbons. We can distinguish several types of hydrocarbons by differences in the bonding between carbon atoms. This leads to differences in geometries and in the hybridization of the carbon orbitals.</para>
<section id="fs-idp53924736">
<title>Alkanes</title>
<para id="fs-idp68413472"><term>Alkanes</term>, or <term>saturated hydrocarbons</term>, contain only single covalent bonds between carbon atoms. Each of the carbon atoms in an alkane has <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals and is bonded to four other atoms, each of which is either carbon or hydrogen. The Lewis structures and models of methane, ethane, and pentane are illustrated in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_20_01_alkanes"/>. Carbon chains are usually drawn as straight lines in Lewis structures, but one has to remember that Lewis structures are not intended to indicate the geometry of molecules. Notice that the carbon atoms in the structural models (the ball-and-stick and space-filling models) of the pentane molecule do not lie in a straight line. Because of the <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> hybridization, the bond angles in carbon chains are close to 109.5°, giving such chains in an alkane a zigzag shape.</para>
<para id="fs-idp72306672">The structures of alkanes and other organic molecules may also be represented in a less detailed manner by condensed structural formulas (or simply, <emphasis effect="italics">condensed formulas</emphasis>). Instead of the usual format for chemical formulas in which each element symbol appears just once, a condensed formula is written to suggest the bonding in the molecule. These formulas have the appearance of a Lewis structure from which most or all of the bond symbols have been removed. Condensed structural formulas for ethane and pentane are shown at the bottom of <link target-id="CNX_Chem_20_01_alkanes"/>, and several additional examples are provided in the exercises at the end of this chapter.</para>

<para id="fs-idp81678112">A common method used by organic chemists to simplify the drawings of larger molecules is to use a <term>skeletal structure</term> (also called a line-angle structure). In this type of structure, carbon atoms are not symbolized with a C, but represented by each end of a line or bend in a line. Hydrogen atoms are not drawn if they are attached to a carbon. Other atoms besides carbon and hydrogen are represented by their elemental symbols. <link target-id="CNX_Chem_20_01_LineStruct1"/> shows three different ways to draw the same structure.</para>

First, an expanded formula shows all individual carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and bonds in a branched hydrocarbon molecule. An initial C atom is bonded to three H atoms. The C atom is bonded to another C atom in the chain. This second C atom is bonded to one H atom and another C atom above the chain. The C atom bonded above the second C atom in the chain is bonded to three H atoms. The second C atom in the chain is bonded to a third C atom in the chain. This third C atom is bonded to on H atom and another C atom below the chain. This C atom is bonded to two H atoms and another C atom below the chain. This second C atom below the chain is bonded to three H atoms. The third C atom in the chain is bonded to a fourth C atom in the chain. The fourth C atom is bonded to two H atoms and a fifth C atom. The fifth C atom is bonded to two H atoms and a sixth C atom. The sixth C atom is bonded to three H atoms. Second, a condensed formula shows each carbon atom of the molecule in clusters with the hydrogen atoms bonded to it, leaving C H, C H subscript 2, and C H subscript 3 groups with bonds between them. The structure shows a C H subscript 3 group bonded to a C H group. The C H group is bonded above to a C H subscript 3 group. The C H group is also bonded to another C H group. This C H group is bonded to a C H subscript 2 group below and a C H subscript 3 group below that. This C H group is also bonded to a C H subscript 2 group which is bonded to another C H subscript 2 group. This C H subscript 2 group is bonded to a final C H subscript 2 group.

<title>The Basics of Organic Nomenclature: Naming Alkanes</title>
<para id="fs-idp41465856">The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (<term class="no-emphasis">IUPAC</term>) has devised a system of nomenclature that begins with the names of the alkanes and can be adjusted from there to account for more complicated structures. The nomenclature for alkanes is based on two rules:</para>
<list id="fs-idp9620576" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
<item>To name an alkane, first identify the longest chain of carbon atoms in its structure. A two-carbon chain is called ethane; a three-carbon chain, propane; and a four-carbon chain, butane. Longer chains are named as follows: pentane (five-carbon chain), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), and decane (10). These prefixes can be seen in the names of the alkanes described in <link target-id="fs-idp53743808"/>.</item>
<item>Add prefixes to the name of the longest chain to indicate the positions and names of <term>substituents</term>. Substituents are branches or functional groups that replace hydrogen atoms on a chain. The position of a substituent or branch is identified by the number of the carbon atom it is bonded to in the chain. We number the carbon atoms in the chain by counting from the end of the chain nearest the substituents. Multiple substituents are named individually and placed in alphabetical order at the front of the name.</item>

<para id="fs-idp69454848">Some hydrocarbons can form more than one type of alkyl group when the hydrogen atoms that would be removed have different “environments” in the molecule. This diversity of possible alkyl groups can be identified in the following way: The four hydrogen atoms in a methane molecule are equivalent; they all have the same environment.

(It may be easier to see the equivalency in the ball and stick models in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_20_01_alkanes"/>. Removal of any one of the four hydrogen atoms from methane forms a methyl group. Likewise, the six hydrogen atoms in ethane are equivalent (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_20_01_alkanes"/>) and removing any one of these hydrogen atoms produces an ethyl group.

The main source of these liquid alkane fuels is crude oil, a complex mixture that is separated by fractional distillation. Fractional distillation takes advantage of differences in the boiling points of the components of the mixture (see <link target-id="CNX_Chem_20_01_FracDistil"/>).

<para id="fs-idm16451072">Polyethylene is a member of one subset of synthetic polymers classified as plastics. Plastics are synthetic organic solids that can be molded; they are typically organic polymers with high molecular masses. Most of the monomers that go into common plastics (ethylene, propylene, vinyl chloride, styrene, and ethylene terephthalate) are derived from petrochemicals and are not very biodegradable, making them candidate materials for recycling. Recycling plastics helps minimize the need for using more of the petrochemical supplies and also minimizes the environmental damage caused by throwing away these nonbiodegradable materials.</para>
<para id="fs-idp49901792">Plastic recycling is the process of recovering waste, scrap, or used plastics, and reprocessing the material into useful products. For example, polyethylene terephthalate (soft drink bottles) can be melted down and used for plastic furniture, in carpets, or for other applications. Other plastics, like polyethylene (bags) and polypropylene (cups, plastic food containers), can be recycled or reprocessed to be used again. Many areas of the country have recycling programs that focus on one or more of the commodity plastics that have been assigned a recycling code (see <link target-id="CNX_Chem_20_01_Recycle"/>). These operations have been in effect since the 1970s and have made the production of some plastics among the most efficient industrial operations today.</para>

<para id="fs-idp39226944">Strong, stable bonds between carbon atoms produce complex molecules containing chains, branches, and rings. The chemistry of these compounds is called organic chemistry. Hydrocarbons are organic compounds composed of only carbon and hydrogen. The alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons—that is, hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds. Alkenes contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds. Alkynes contain one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds. Aromatic hydrocarbons contain ring structures with delocalized π electron systems.</para>

In the saturated hydrocarbon, an existing C–H bond is broken, and a bond between the C and the Br can then be formed. In the unsaturated hydrocarbon, the only bond broken in the hydrocarbon is the π bond whose electrons can be used to form a bond to one of the bromine atoms in Br<sub>2</sub> (the electrons from the Br–Br bond form the other C–Br bond on the other carbon that was part of the π bond in the starting unsaturated hydrocarbon).</para>
