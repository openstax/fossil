<p id="fs-idp120146608">The hemoglobin in your blood, the chlorophyll in green plants, vitamin B-12, and the catalyst used in the manufacture of polyethylene all contain coordination compounds.

<p id="fs-idp92015616">Remember that in most main group element compounds, the valence electrons of the isolated atoms combine to form chemical bonds that satisfy the octet rule. For instance, the four valence electrons of carbon overlap with electrons from four hydrogen atoms to form CH<sub>4</sub>. The one valence electron leaves sodium and adds to the seven valence electrons of chlorine to form the ionic formula unit NaCl (<a href="#CNX_Chem_19_02_BondType" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Transition metals do not normally bond in this fashion. They primarily form coordinate covalent bonds, a form of the Lewis acid-base interaction in which both of the electrons in the bond are contributed by a donor (Lewis base) to an electron acceptor (Lewis acid). The Lewis acid in coordination complexes, often called a <span data-type="term">central metal</span> ion (or atom), is often a transition metal or inner transition metal, although main group elements can also form <span data-type="term">coordination compounds</span>. The Lewis base donors, called <span data-type="term">ligands</span>, can be a wide variety of chemicals&#8212;atoms, molecules, or ions. The only requirement is that they have one or more electron pairs, which can be donated to the central metal. Most often, this involves a <span data-type="term">donor atom</span> with a lone pair of electrons that can form a coordinate bond to the metal.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_19_02_BondType" class="scaled-down"><figcaption>(a) Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons, and ionic bonds involve the transferring of electrons associated with each bonding atom, as indicated by the colored electrons. (b) However, coordinate covalent bonds involve electrons from a Lewis base being donated to a metal center. The lone pairs from six water molecules form bonds to the scandium ion to form an octahedral complex. (Only the donated pairs are shown.)</figcaption>

<li>If more than one ligand of a given type is present, the number is indicated by the prefixes <em data-effect="italics">di</em>- (for two), <em data-effect="italics">tri</em>- (for three), <em data-effect="italics">tetra</em>- (for four), <em data-effect="italics">penta</em>- (for five), and <em data-effect="italics">hexa</em>- (for six). Sometimes, the prefixes <em data-effect="italics">bis</em>- (for two), <em data-effect="italics">tris</em>- (for three), and <em data-effect="italics">tetrakis</em>- (for four) are used when the name of the ligand already includes <em data-effect="italics">di</em>-, <em data-effect="italics">tri</em>-, or <em data-effect="italics">tetra</em>-, or when the ligand name begins with a vowel. For example, the ion bis(bipyridyl)osmium(II) uses bis- to signify that there are two ligands attached to Os, and each bipyridyl ligand contains two pyridine groups (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N).</li>
</ol><p id="fs-idp261455600">When the complex is either a cation or a neutral molecule, the name of the central metal atom is spelled exactly like the name of the element and is followed by a Roman numeral in parentheses to indicate its oxidation state (<a href="#fs-idp99540896" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#fs-idp97436016" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). When the complex is an anion, the suffix -ate is added to the stem of the name of the metal, followed by the Roman numeral designation of its oxidation state (<a href="#fs-idp240256816" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Sometimes, the Latin name of the metal is used when the English name is clumsy. For example, <em data-effect="italics">ferrate</em> is used instead of <em data-effect="italics">ironate</em>, <em data-effect="italics">plumbate</em> instead <em data-effect="italics">leadate</em>, and <em data-effect="italics">stannate</em> instead of <em data-effect="italics">tinate</em>. The oxidation state of the metal is determined based on the charges of each ligand and the overall charge of the coordination compound. For example, in [Cr(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]Br, the coordination sphere (in brackets) has a charge of 1+ to balance the bromide ion. The water ligands are neutral, and the chloride ligands are anionic with a charge of 1&#8722; each. To determine the oxidation state of the metal, we set the overall charge equal to the sum of the ligands and the metal: +1 = &#8722;2 + <em data-effect="italics">x</em>, so the oxidation state (<em data-effect="italics">x</em>) is equal to 3+.</p>

<p id="fs-idm258352">Different geometric isomers of a substance are different chemical compounds. They exhibit different properties, even though they have the same formula. For example, the two isomers of [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]NO<sub>3</sub> differ in color; the <em data-effect="italics">cis</em> form is violet, and the <em data-effect="italics">trans</em> form is green. Furthermore, these isomers have different dipole moments, solubilities, and reactivities. As an example of how the arrangement in space can influence the molecular properties, consider the polarity of the two [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]NO<sub>3</sub> isomers. Remember that the polarity of a molecule or ion is determined by the bond dipoles (which are due to the difference in electronegativity of the bonding atoms) and their arrangement in space. In one isomer, <em data-effect="italics">cis</em> chloride ligands cause more electron density on one side of the molecule than on the other, making it polar.

<p id="fs-idp18845840">Another important type of isomers are <span data-type="term">optical isomers</span>, or <span data-type="term">enantiomers</span>, in which two objects are exact mirror images of each other but cannot be lined up so that all parts match. This means that optical isomers are nonsuperimposable mirror images. A classic example of this is a pair of hands, in which the right and left hand are mirror images of one another but cannot be superimposed. Optical isomers are very important in organic and biochemistry because living systems often incorporate one specific optical isomer and not the other. Unlike geometric isomers, pairs of optical isomers have identical properties (boiling point, polarity, solubility, etc.). Optical isomers differ only in the way they affect polarized light and how they react with other optical isomers. For coordination complexes, many coordination compounds such as [M(en)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>n+</sup> [in which M<sup>n+</sup> is a central metal ion such as iron(III) or cobalt(II)] form enantiomers, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_19_02_enant" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. These two isomers will react differently with other optical isomers. For example, DNA helices are optical isomers, and the form that occurs in nature (right-handed DNA) will bind to only one isomer of [M(en)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>n+</sup> and not the other.</p>

<p id="fs-idp55376000">One of the most important applications of transition metals is as industrial catalysts. As you recall from the chapter on kinetics, a catalyst increases the rate of reaction by lowering the activation energy and is regenerated in the catalytic cycle. Over 90% of all manufactured products are made with the aid of one or more catalysts. The ability to bind ligands and change oxidation states makes transition metal catalysts well suited for catalytic applications. Vanadium oxide is used to produce 230,000,000 tons of sulfuric acid worldwide each year, which in turn is used to make everything from fertilizers to cans for food. Plastics are made with the aid of transition metal catalysts, along with detergents, fertilizers, paints, and more (see <a href="#CNX_Chem_19_02_Cat" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Very complicated pharmaceuticals are manufactured with catalysts that are selective, reacting with one specific bond out of a large number of possibilities. Catalysts allow processes to be more economical and more environmentally friendly. Developing new catalysts and better understanding of existing systems are important areas of current research.</p>

The square planar copper(II) complex phthalocyanine blue (from <a href="#CNX_Chem_19_02_ChlorBlue" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) is one of many complexes used as pigments or dyes.

<p id="fs-idp36165472">The structure of heme (<a href="#CNX_Chem_19_02_heme2" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), the iron-containing complex in hemoglobin, is very similar to that in chlorophyll. In hemoglobin, the red heme complex is bonded to a large protein molecule (globin) by the attachment of the protein to the heme ligand. Oxygen molecules are transported by hemoglobin in the blood by being bound to the iron center. When the hemoglobin loses its oxygen, the color changes to a bluish red. Hemoglobin will only transport oxygen if the iron is Fe<sup>2+</sup>; oxidation of the iron to Fe<sup>3+</sup> prevents oxygen transport.</p>

<p id="fs-idp85288896">Complexing agents often are used for water softening because they tie up such ions as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, which make water hard. Many metal ions are also undesirable in food products because these ions can catalyze reactions that change the color of food. Coordination complexes are useful as preservatives. For example, the ligand EDTA, (HO<sub>2</sub>CCH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>N(CH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>, coordinates to metal ions through six donor atoms and prevents the metals from reacting (<a href="#CNX_Chem_19_02_EDTA" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).

<p id="fs-idp158915696">Complexing agents that tie up metal ions are also used as drugs. British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), HSCH<sub>2</sub>CH(SH)CH<sub>2</sub>OH, is a drug developed during World War I as an antidote for the arsenic-based war gas Lewisite. BAL is now used to treat poisoning by heavy metals, such as arsenic, mercury, thallium, and chromium. The drug is a ligand and functions by making a water-soluble chelate of the metal; the kidneys eliminate this metal chelate (<a href="#CNX_Chem_19_02_BalEnt" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Another polydentate ligand, enterobactin, which is isolated from certain bacteria, is used to form complexes of iron and thereby to control the severe iron buildup found in patients suffering from blood diseases such as Cooley&#8217;s anemia, who require frequent transfusions. As the transfused blood breaks down, the usual metabolic processes that remove iron are overloaded, and excess iron can build up to fatal levels. Enterobactin forms a water-soluble complex with excess iron, and the body can safely eliminate this complex.</p>

All of the oxygen and sulfur atoms have lone pairs of electrons that can be used to coordinate to a metal center, so there are six possible donor atoms. Geometrically, only two of these atoms can be coordinated to a metal at once. The most common binding mode involves the coordination of one sulfur atom and one oxygen atom, forming a five-member ring with the metal.</p>

<p id="fs-idp58173136">Ligands are also used in the electroplating industry. When metal ions are reduced to produce thin metal coatings, metals can clump together to form clusters and nanoparticles. When metal coordination complexes are used, the ligands keep the metal atoms isolated from each other. It has been found that many metals plate out as a smoother, more uniform, better-looking, and more adherent surface when plated from a bath containing the metal as a complex ion. Thus, complexes such as [Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>&#8722;</sup> and [Au(CN)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>&#8722;</sup> are used extensively in the electroplating industry.</p>
<p id="fs-idp128300928">In 1965, scientists at Michigan State University discovered that there was a platinum complex that inhibited cell division in certain microorganisms.

The inhibition of cell division indicated that this square planar compound could be an anticancer agent. In 1978, the US Food and Drug Administration approved this compound, known as cisplatin, for use in the treatment of certain forms of cancer. Since that time, many similar platinum compounds have been developed for the treatment of cancer. In all cases, these are the <em data-effect="italics">cis</em> isomers and never the <em data-effect="italics">trans</em> isomers.

<p id="fs-idm3937184">The transition elements and main group elements can form coordination compounds, or complexes, in which a central metal atom or ion is bonded to one or more ligands by coordinate covalent bonds. Ligands with more than one donor atom are called polydentate ligands and form chelates. The common geometries found in complexes are tetrahedral and square planar (both with a coordination number of four) and octahedral (with a coordination number of six). <em data-effect="italics">Cis</em> and <em data-effect="italics">trans</em> configurations are possible in some octahedral and square planar complexes. In addition to these geometrical isomers, optical isomers (molecules or ions that are mirror images but not superimposable) are possible in certain octahedral complexes.
