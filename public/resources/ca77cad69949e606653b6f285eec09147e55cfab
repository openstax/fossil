<p id="fs-id2766959">Communication is a process in which a sender transmits signals to one or more receivers to control and coordinate actions. In the human body, two major organ systems participate in relatively &#8220;long distance&#8221; communication: the nervous system and the endocrine system. Together, these two systems are primarily responsible for maintaining homeostasis in the body.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1308430"><h3 data-type="title">Neural and Endocrine Signaling</h3>
<p id="fs-id1201632">The nervous system uses two types of intercellular communication&#8212;electrical and chemical signaling&#8212;either by the direct action of an electrical potential, or in the latter case, through the action of chemical neurotransmitters such as serotonin or norepinephrine. Neurotransmitters act locally and rapidly. When an electrical signal in the form of an action potential arrives at the synaptic terminal, they diffuse across the synaptic cleft (the gap between a sending neuron and a receiving neuron or muscle cell). Once the neurotransmitters interact (bind) with receptors on the receiving (post-synaptic) cell, the receptor stimulation is transduced into a response such as continued electrical signaling or modification of cellular response. The target cell responds within milliseconds of receiving the chemical &#8220;message&#8221;; this response then ceases very quickly once the neural signaling ends. In this way, neural communication enables body functions that involve quick, brief actions, such as movement, sensation, and cognition.In contrast, the <span data-type="term">endocrine system</span> uses just one method of communication: chemical signaling. These signals are sent by the endocrine organs, which secrete chemicals&#8212;the <span data-type="term">hormone</span>&#8212;into the extracellular fluid. Hormones are transported primarily via the bloodstream throughout the body, where they bind to receptors on target cells, inducing a characteristic response. As a result, endocrine signaling requires more time than neural signaling to prompt a response in target cells, though the precise amount of time varies with different hormones. For example, the hormones released when you are confronted with a dangerous or frightening situation, called the fight-or-flight response, occur by the release of adrenal hormones&#8212;epinephrine and norepinephrine&#8212;within seconds. In contrast, it may take up to 48 hours for target cells to respond to certain reproductive hormones.</p>

</div>
<p id="fs-id1967528">In addition, endocrine signaling is typically less specific than neural signaling. The same hormone may play a role in a variety of different physiological processes depending on the target cells involved. For example, the hormone oxytocin promotes uterine contractions in women in labor. It is also important in breastfeeding, and may be involved in the sexual response and in feelings of emotional attachment in both males and females.</p>
<p id="fs-id2582199">In general, the nervous system involves quick responses to rapid changes in the external environment, and the endocrine system is usually slower acting&#8212;taking care of the internal environment of the body, maintaining homeostasis, and controlling reproduction (<a href="#tbl-ch18_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). So how does the fight-or-flight response that was mentioned earlier happen so quickly if hormones are usually slower acting? It is because the two systems are connected. It is the fast action of the nervous system in response to the danger in the environment that stimulates the adrenal glands to secrete their hormones. As a result, the nervous system can cause rapid endocrine responses to keep up with sudden changes in both the external and internal environments when necessary.</p><table class="top-titled" id="tbl-ch18_01" summary=""><thead>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2074268"><h3 data-type="title">Structures of the Endocrine System</h3><p id="eip-269">The endocrine system consists of cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones as a primary or secondary function. The <span data-type="term">endocrine gland</span> is the major player in this system. The primary function of these ductless glands is to secrete their hormones directly into the surrounding fluid. The interstitial fluid and the blood vessels then transport the hormones throughout the body. The endocrine system includes the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal glands (<a href="#fig-ch18_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Some of these glands have both endocrine and non-endocrine functions. For example, the pancreas contains cells that function in digestion as well as cells that secrete the hormones insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood glucose levels. The hypothalamus, thymus, heart, kidneys, stomach, small intestine, liver, skin, female ovaries, and male testes are other organs that contain cells with endocrine function. Moreover, adipose tissue has long been known to produce hormones, and recent research has revealed that even bone tissue has endocrine functions.</p><figure id="fig-ch18_01_01"><div data-type="title">Endocrine System </div><figcaption>Endocrine glands and cells are located throughout the body and play an important role in homeostasis.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id1640739" data-alt="This diagram shows the endocrine glands and cells that are located throughout the body.

</figure><p id="fs-id1864554">The ductless endocrine glands are not to be confused with the body&#8217;s <span data-type="term">exocrine system</span>, whose glands release their secretions through ducts. Examples of exocrine glands include the sebaceous and sweat glands of the skin. As just noted, the pancreas also has an exocrine function: most of its cells secrete pancreatic juice through the pancreatic and accessory ducts to the lumen of the small intestine.</p></section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1489991"><h3 data-type="title">Other Types of Chemical Signaling</h3>
<p id="fs-id2211056">In endocrine signaling, hormones secreted into the extracellular fluid diffuse into the blood or lymph, and can then travel great distances throughout the body. In contrast, autocrine signaling takes place within the same cell. An <span data-type="term">autocrine</span> (auto- = &#8220;self&#8221;) is a chemical that elicits a response in the same cell that secreted it. Interleukin-1, or IL-1, is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in inflammatory response. The cells that secrete IL-1 have receptors on their cell surface that bind these molecules, resulting in autocrine signaling.</p>
<p id="fs-id2166436">Local intercellular communication is the province of the <span data-type="term">paracrine</span>, also called a paracrine factor, which is a chemical that induces a response in neighboring cells. Although paracrines may enter the bloodstream, their concentration is generally too low to elicit a response from distant tissues. A familiar example to those with asthma is histamine, a paracrine that is released by immune cells in the bronchial tree. Histamine causes the smooth muscle cells of the bronchi to constrict, narrowing the airways. Another example is the neurotransmitters of the nervous system, which act only locally within the synaptic cleft.</p>

<p id="fs-id1331288"><span data-type="title">Endocrinologist</span>
Endocrinology is a specialty in the field of medicine that focuses on the treatment of endocrine system disorders. Endocrinologists&#8212;medical doctors who specialize in this field&#8212;are experts in treating diseases associated with hormonal systems, ranging from thyroid disease to diabetes mellitus. Endocrine surgeons treat endocrine disease through the removal, or resection, of the affected endocrine gland.</p>
<p id="fs-id1118719">Patients who are referred to endocrinologists may have signs and symptoms or blood test results that suggest excessive or impaired functioning of an endocrine gland or endocrine cells. The endocrinologist may order additional blood tests to determine whether the patient&#8217;s hormonal levels are abnormal, or they may stimulate or suppress the function of the suspect endocrine gland and then have blood taken for analysis. Treatment varies according to the diagnosis. Some endocrine disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, may respond to lifestyle changes such as modest weight loss, adoption of a healthy diet, and regular physical activity. Other disorders may require medication, such as hormone replacement, and routine monitoring by the endocrinologist. These include disorders of the pituitary gland that can affect growth and disorders of the thyroid gland that can result in a variety of metabolic problems.</p>
<p id="fs-id1534880">Some patients experience health problems as a result of the normal decline in hormones that can accompany aging. These patients can consult with an endocrinologist to weigh the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy intended to boost their natural levels of reproductive hormones.</p>
<p id="fs-id2913512">In addition to treating patients, endocrinologists may be involved in research to improve the understanding of endocrine system disorders and develop new treatments for these diseases.</p></div>

<p id="fs-id1230452">The endocrine system consists of cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones critical to homeostasis. The body coordinates its functions through two major types of communication: neural and endocrine. Neural communication includes both electrical and chemical signaling between neurons and target cells. Endocrine communication involves chemical signaling via the release of hormones into the extracellular fluid. From there, hormones diffuse into the bloodstream and may travel to distant body regions, where they elicit a response in target cells. Endocrine glands are ductless glands that secrete hormones. Many organs of the body with other primary functions&#8212;such as the heart, stomach, and kidneys&#8212;also have hormone-secreting cells.</p>

<div data-type="problem" id="fs-id1526539"><p id="fs-id1229076">Describe several main differences in the communication methods used by the endocrine system and the nervous system.</p></div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1527042" data-label="">
<p id="fs-id1496734">The endocrine system uses chemical signals called hormones to convey information from one part of the body to a distant part of the body. Hormones are released from the endocrine cell into the extracellular environment, but then travel in the bloodstream to target tissues. This communication and response can take seconds to days. In contrast, neurons transmit electrical signals along their axons. At the axon terminal, the electrical signal prompts the release of a chemical signal called a neurotransmitter that carries the message across the synaptic cleft to elicit a response in the neighboring cell. This method of communication is nearly instantaneous, of very brief duration, and is highly specific.</p>

<p id="fs-id1860241">Endocrine glands are ductless. They release their secretion into the surrounding fluid, from which it enters the bloodstream or lymph to travel to distant cells. Moreover, the secretions of endocrine glands are hormones. Exocrine glands release their secretions through a duct that delivers the secretion to the target location. Moreover, the secretions of exocrine glands are not hormones, but compounds that have an immediate physiologic function. For example, pancreatic juice contains enzymes that help digest food.</p>
