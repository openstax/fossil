<p id="fs-id1492562">Virtually every cell, tissue, organ, and system in the body is impacted by the circulatory system. This includes the generalized and more specialized functions of transport of materials, capillary exchange, maintaining health by transporting white blood cells and various immunoglobulins (antibodies), hemostasis, regulation of body temperature, and helping to maintain acid-base balance. In addition to these shared functions, many systems enjoy a unique relationship with the circulatory system. <a href="#fig-ch21_05_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> summarizes these relationships.</p>

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id1351620">As you learn about the vessels of the systemic and pulmonary circuits, notice that many arteries and veins share the same names, parallel one another throughout the body, and are very similar on the right and left sides of the body. These pairs of vessels will be traced through only one side of the body. Where differences occur in branching patterns or when vessels are singular, this will be indicated. For example, you will find a pair of femoral arteries and a pair of femoral veins, with one vessel on each side of the body. In contrast, some vessels closer to the midline of the body, such as the aorta, are unique. Moreover, some superficial veins, such as the great saphenous vein in the femoral region, have no arterial counterpart. Another phenomenon that can make the study of vessels challenging is that names of vessels can change with location. Like a street that changes name as it passes through an intersection, an artery or vein can change names as it passes an anatomical landmark. For example, the left subclavian artery becomes the axillary artery as it passes through the body wall and into the axillary region, and then becomes the brachial artery as it flows from the axillary region into the upper arm (or brachium). You will also find examples of anastomoses where two blood vessels that previously branched reconnect. Anastomoses are especially common in veins, where they help maintain blood flow even when one vessel is blocked or narrowed, although there are some important ones in the arteries supplying the brain.</p>
<p id="fs-id2112150">As you read about circular pathways, notice that there is an occasional, very large artery referred to as a <span data-type="term">trunk</span>, a term indicating that the vessel gives rise to several smaller arteries. For example, the celiac trunk gives rise to the left gastric, common hepatic, and splenic arteries.</p>
<p id="fs-id1546384">As you study this section, imagine you are on a &#8220;Voyage of Discovery&#8221; similar to Lewis and Clark&#8217;s expedition in 1804&#8211;1806, which followed rivers and streams through unfamiliar territory, seeking a water route from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. You might envision being inside a miniature boat, exploring the various branches of the circulatory system. This simple approach has proven effective for many students in mastering these major circulatory patterns. Another approach that works well for many students is to create simple line drawings similar to the ones provided, labeling each of the major vessels. It is beyond the scope of this text to name every vessel in the body. However, we will attempt to discuss the major pathways for blood and acquaint you with the major named arteries and veins in the body. Also, please keep in mind that individual variations in circulation patterns are not uncommon.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2677637"><h3 data-type="title">Pulmonary Circulation</h3>
<p id="fs-id2459158">Recall that blood returning from the systemic circuit enters the right atrium (<a href="#fig-ch21_05_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) via the superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus, which drains the blood supply of the heart muscle. These vessels will be described more fully later in this section. This blood is relatively low in oxygen and relatively high in carbon dioxide, since much of the oxygen has been extracted for use by the tissues and the waste gas carbon dioxide was picked up to be transported to the lungs for elimination. From the right atrium, blood moves into the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs for gas exchange. This system of vessels is referred to as the <span data-type="term">pulmonary circuit</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-id2182350">The single vessel exiting the right ventricle is the <span data-type="term">pulmonary trunk</span>. At the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar valve, which prevents backflow of blood into the right ventricle during ventricular diastole. As the pulmonary trunk reaches the superior surface of the heart, it curves posteriorly and rapidly bifurcates (divides) into two branches, a left and a right <span data-type="term">pulmonary artery</span>. To prevent confusion between these vessels, it is important to refer to the vessel exiting the heart as the pulmonary trunk, rather than also calling it a pulmonary artery. The pulmonary arteries in turn branch many times within the lung, forming a series of smaller arteries and arterioles that eventually lead to the pulmonary capillaries. The pulmonary capillaries surround lung structures known as alveoli that are the sites of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange.</p>
<p id="fs-id2553390">Once gas exchange is completed, oxygenated blood flows from the pulmonary capillaries into a series of pulmonary venules that eventually lead to a series of larger <span data-type="term">pulmonary veins</span>. Four pulmonary veins, two on the left and two on the right, return blood to the left atrium. At this point, the pulmonary circuit is complete. <a href="#tbl-ch21_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> defines the major arteries and veins of the pulmonary circuit discussed in the text.</p>

<p id="fs-id1497055">Blood relatively high in oxygen concentration is returned from the pulmonary circuit to the left atrium via the four pulmonary veins. From the left atrium, blood moves into the left ventricle, which pumps blood into the aorta.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2153789"><h3 data-type="title">The Aorta</h3><p id="fs-id1917178">The <span data-type="term">aorta</span> is the largest artery in the body (<a href="#fig-ch21_05_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). It arises from the left ventricle and eventually descends to the abdominal region, where it bifurcates at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra into the two common iliac arteries. The aorta consists of the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta, which passes through the diaphragm and a landmark that divides into the superior thoracic and inferior abdominal components. Arteries originating from the aorta ultimately distribute blood to virtually all tissues of the body. At the base of the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve that prevents backflow of blood into the left ventricle while the heart is relaxing. After exiting the heart, the <span data-type="term">ascending aorta</span> moves in a superior direction for approximately 5 cm and ends at the sternal angle. Following this ascent, it reverses direction, forming a graceful arc to the left, called the <span data-type="term">aortic arch</span>. The aortic arch descends toward the inferior portions of the body and ends at the level of the intervertebral disk between the fourth and fifth thoracic vertebrae. Beyond this point, the <span data-type="term">descending aorta</span> continues close to the bodies of the vertebrae and passes through an opening in the diaphragm known as the <span data-type="term">aortic hiatus</span>. Superior to the diaphragm, the aorta is called the <span data-type="term">thoracic aorta</span>, and inferior to the diaphragm, it is called the <span data-type="term">abdominal aorta</span>.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2964934"><h4 data-type="title">Coronary Circulation</h4>
<p id="fs-id1731871">The first vessels that branch from the ascending aorta are the paired coronary arteries (see <a href="#fig-ch21_05_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), which arise from two of the three sinuses in the ascending aorta just superior to the aortic semilunar valve. These sinuses contain the aortic baroreceptors and chemoreceptors critical to maintain cardiac function. The left coronary artery arises from the left posterior aortic sinus. The right coronary artery arises from the anterior aortic sinus. Normally, the right posterior aortic sinus does not give rise to a vessel.</p>
<p id="fs-id2002287">The coronary arteries encircle the heart, forming a ring-like structure that divides into the next level of branches that supplies blood to the heart tissues. (Seek additional content for more detail on cardiac circulation.)</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1807248"><h4 data-type="title">Aortic Arch Branches</h4><p id="fs-id2381708">There are three major branches of the aortic arch: the brachiocephalic artery, the left common carotid artery, and the left subclavian (literally &#8220;under the clavicle&#8221;) artery. As you would expect based upon proximity to the heart, each of these vessels is classified as an elastic artery.</p>
<p id="fs-id1370379">The brachiocephalic artery is located only on the right side of the body; there is no corresponding artery on the left. The brachiocephalic artery branches into the right subclavian artery and the right common carotid artery. The left subclavian and left common carotid arteries arise independently from the aortic arch but otherwise follow a similar pattern and distribution to the corresponding arteries on the right side (see <a href="#fig-ch21_05_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<p id="fs-id2009844">Each <span data-type="term">subclavian artery</span> supplies blood to the arms, chest, shoulders, back, and central nervous system. It then gives rise to three major branches: the internal thoracic artery, the vertebral artery, and the thyrocervical artery. The <span data-type="term">internal thoracic artery</span>, or mammary artery, supplies blood to the thymus, the pericardium of the heart, and the anterior chest wall. The <span data-type="term">vertebral artery</span> passes through the vertebral foramen in the cervical vertebrae and then through the foramen magnum into the cranial cavity to supply blood to the brain and spinal cord. The paired vertebral arteries join together to form the large basilar artery at the base of the medulla oblongata. This is an example of an anastomosis. The subclavian artery also gives rise to the <span data-type="term">thyrocervical artery</span> that provides blood to the thyroid, the cervical region of the neck, and the upper back and shoulder.</p>
<p id="fs-id1351490">The <span data-type="term">common carotid artery</span> divides into internal and external carotid arteries. The right common carotid artery arises from the brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery arises directly from the aortic arch. The <span data-type="term">external carotid artery</span> supplies blood to numerous structures within the face, lower jaw, neck, esophagus, and larynx. These branches include the lingual, facial, occipital, maxillary, and superficial temporal arteries. The <span data-type="term">internal carotid artery</span> initially forms an expansion known as the carotid sinus, containing the carotid baroreceptors and chemoreceptors. Like their counterparts in the aortic sinuses, the information provided by these receptors is critical to maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis (see <a href="#fig-ch21_05_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<p id="fs-id2643816">The internal carotid arteries along with the vertebral arteries are the two primary suppliers of blood to the human brain. Given the central role and vital importance of the brain to life, it is critical that blood supply to this organ remains uninterrupted. Recall that blood flow to the brain is remarkably constant, with approximately 20 percent of blood flow directed to this organ at any given time. When blood flow is interrupted, even for just a few seconds, a <span data-type="term">transient ischemic attack (TIA)</span>, or mini-stroke, may occur, resulting in loss of consciousness or temporary loss of neurological function. In some cases, the damage may be permanent. Loss of blood flow for longer periods, typically between 3 and 4 minutes, will likely produce irreversible brain damage or a stroke, also called a <span data-type="term">cerebrovascular accident (CVA)</span>. The locations of the arteries in the brain not only provide blood flow to the brain tissue but also prevent interruption in the flow of blood. Both the carotid and vertebral arteries branch once they enter the cranial cavity, and some of these branches form a structure known as the <span data-type="term">arterial circle</span> (or <span data-type="term">circle of Willis</span>), an anastomosis that is remarkably like a traffic circle that sends off branches (in this case, arterial branches to the brain). As a rule, branches to the anterior portion of the cerebrum are normally fed by the internal carotid arteries; the remainder of the brain receives blood flow from branches associated with the vertebral arteries.</p>
<p id="fs-id1278587">The internal carotid artery continues through the carotid canal of the temporal bone and enters the base of the brain through the carotid foramen where it gives rise to several branches (<a href="#fig-ch21_05_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#fig-ch21_05_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). One of these branches is the <span data-type="term">anterior cerebral artery</span> that supplies blood to the frontal lobe of the cerebrum. Another branch, the <span data-type="term">middle cerebral artery</span>, supplies blood to the temporal and parietal lobes, which are the most common sites of CVAs. The <span data-type="term">ophthalmic artery</span>, the third major branch, provides blood to the eyes.</p>
<p id="fs-id1713551">The right and left anterior cerebral arteries join together to form an anastomosis called the <span data-type="term">anterior communicating artery</span>. The initial segments of the anterior cerebral arteries and the anterior communicating artery form the anterior portion of the arterial circle. The posterior portion of the arterial circle is formed by a left and a right <span data-type="term">posterior communicating artery</span> that branches from the <span data-type="term">posterior cerebral artery</span>, which arises from the basilar artery. It provides blood to the posterior portion of the cerebrum and brain stem. The <span data-type="term">basilar artery</span> is an anastomosis that begins at the junction of the two vertebral arteries and sends branches to the cerebellum and brain stem. It flows into the posterior cerebral arteries. <a href="#tbl-ch21_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> summarizes the aortic arch branches, including the major branches supplying the brain.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch21_05_05"><div data-type="title">Arteries Supplying the Head and Neck </div><figcaption>The common carotid artery gives rise to the external and internal carotid arteries. The external carotid artery remains superficial and gives rise to many arteries of the head. The internal carotid artery first forms the carotid sinus and then reaches the brain via the carotid canal and carotid foramen, emerging into the cranium via the foramen lacerum. The vertebral artery branches from the subclavian artery and passes through the transverse foramen in the cervical vertebrae, entering the base of the skull at the vertebral foramen.

</section><section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2882574"><h4 data-type="title">Thoracic Aorta and Major Branches</h4><p id="fs-id2468777">The thoracic aorta begins at the level of vertebra T5 and continues through to the diaphragm at the level of T12, initially traveling within the mediastinum to the left of the vertebral column. As it passes through the thoracic region, the thoracic aorta gives rise to several branches, which are collectively referred to as visceral branches and parietal branches (<a href="#fig-ch21_05_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Those branches that supply blood primarily to visceral organs are known as the <span data-type="term">visceral branches</span> and include the bronchial arteries, pericardial arteries, esophageal arteries, and the mediastinal arteries, each named after the tissues it supplies. Each <span data-type="term">bronchial artery</span> (typically two on the left and one on the right) supplies systemic blood to the lungs and visceral pleura, in addition to the blood pumped to the lungs for oxygenation via the pulmonary circuit. The bronchial arteries follow the same path as the respiratory branches, beginning with the bronchi and ending with the bronchioles. There is considerable, but not total, intermingling of the systemic and pulmonary blood at anastomoses in the smaller branches of the lungs. This may sound incongruous&#8212;that is, the mixing of systemic arterial blood high in oxygen with the pulmonary arterial blood lower in oxygen&#8212;but the systemic vessels also deliver nutrients to the lung tissue just as they do elsewhere in the body.

</section><section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2158043"><h4 data-type="title">Abdominal Aorta and Major Branches</h4><p id="fs-id2241300">After crossing through the diaphragm at the aortic hiatus, the thoracic aorta is called the abdominal aorta (see <a href="#fig-ch21_05_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). This vessel remains to the left of the vertebral column and is embedded in adipose tissue behind the peritoneal cavity. It formally ends at approximately the level of vertebra L4, where it bifurcates to form the common iliac arteries. Before this division, the abdominal aorta gives rise to several important branches. A single <span data-type="term">celiac trunk</span> (artery) emerges and divides into the <span data-type="term">left gastric artery</span> to supply blood to the stomach and esophagus, the <span data-type="term">splenic artery</span> to supply blood to the spleen, and the <span data-type="term">common hepatic artery</span>, which in turn gives rise to the <span data-type="term">hepatic artery proper</span> to supply blood to the liver, the <span data-type="term">right gastric artery</span> to supply blood to the stomach, the <span data-type="term">cystic artery</span> to supply blood to the gall bladder, and several branches, one to supply blood to the duodenum and another to supply blood to the pancreas. Two additional single vessels arise from the abdominal aorta. These are the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. The <span data-type="term">superior mesenteric artery</span> arises approximately 2.5 cm after the celiac trunk and branches into several major vessels that supply blood to the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), the pancreas, and a majority of the large intestine. The <span data-type="term">inferior mesenteric artery</span> supplies blood to the distal segment of the large intestine, including the rectum. It arises approximately 5 cm superior to the common iliac arteries.</p>
<p id="fs-id2178135">In addition to these single branches, the abdominal aorta gives rise to several significant paired arteries along the way. These include the inferior phrenic arteries, the adrenal arteries, the renal arteries, the gonadal arteries, and the lumbar arteries. Each <span data-type="term">inferior phrenic artery</span> is a counterpart of a superior phrenic artery and supplies blood to the inferior surface of the diaphragm. The <span data-type="term">adrenal artery</span> supplies blood to the adrenal (suprarenal) glands and arises near the superior mesenteric artery. Each <span data-type="term">renal artery</span> branches approximately 2.5 cm inferior to the superior mesenteric arteries and supplies a kidney. The right renal artery is longer than the left since the aorta lies to the left of the vertebral column and the vessel must travel a greater distance to reach its target. Renal arteries branch repeatedly to supply blood to the kidneys. Each <span data-type="term">gonadal artery</span> supplies blood to the gonads, or reproductive organs, and is also described as either an ovarian artery or a testicular artery (internal spermatic), depending upon the sex of the individual. An <span data-type="term">ovarian artery</span> supplies blood to an ovary, uterine (Fallopian) tube, and the uterus, and is located within the suspensory ligament of the uterus. It is considerably shorter than a <span data-type="term">testicular artery</span>, which ultimately travels outside the body cavity to the testes, forming one component of the spermatic cord. The gonadal arteries arise inferior to the renal arteries and are generally retroperitoneal. The ovarian artery continues to the uterus where it forms an anastomosis with the uterine artery that supplies blood to the uterus. Both the uterine arteries and vaginal arteries, which distribute blood to the vagina, are branches of the internal iliac artery. The four paired <span data-type="term">lumbar arteries</span> are the counterparts of the intercostal arteries and supply blood to the lumbar region, the abdominal wall, and the spinal cord. In some instances, a fifth pair of lumbar arteries emerges from the median sacral artery.</p>
<p id="fs-id1448091">The aorta divides at approximately the level of vertebra L4 into a left and a right <span data-type="term">common iliac artery</span> but continues as a small vessel, the <span data-type="term">median sacral artery</span>, into the sacrum. The common iliac arteries provide blood to the pelvic region and ultimately to the lower limbs. They split into external and internal iliac arteries approximately at the level of the lumbar-sacral articulation. Each <span data-type="term">internal iliac artery</span> sends branches to the urinary bladder, the walls of the pelvis, the external genitalia, and the medial portion of the femoral region. In females, they also provide blood to the uterus and vagina. The much larger <span data-type="term">external iliac artery</span> supplies blood to each of the lower limbs. <a href="#fig-ch21_05_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the distribution of the major branches of the aorta into the thoracic and abdominal regions. <a href="#fig-ch21_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the distribution of the major branches of the common iliac arteries. <a href="#tbl-ch21_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> summarizes the major branches of the abdominal aorta.</p>

</section><section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1254092"><h3 data-type="title">Overview of Systemic Veins</h3>
<p id="fs-id1952919">Systemic veins return blood to the right atrium. Since the blood has already passed through the systemic capillaries, it will be relatively low in oxygen concentration. In many cases, there will be veins draining organs and regions of the body with the same name as the arteries that supplied these regions and the two often parallel one another. This is often described as a &#8220;complementary&#8221; pattern. However, there is a great deal more variability in the venous circulation than normally occurs in the arteries. For the sake of brevity and clarity, this text will discuss only the most commonly encountered patterns. However, keep this variation in mind when you move from the classroom to clinical practice.</p>
<p id="fs-id1559630">In both the neck and limb regions, there are often both superficial and deeper levels of veins. The deeper veins generally correspond to the complementary arteries. The superficial veins do not normally have direct arterial counterparts, but in addition to returning blood, they also make contributions to the maintenance of body temperature. When the ambient temperature is warm, more blood is diverted to the superficial veins where heat can be more easily dissipated to the environment. In colder weather, there is more constriction of the superficial veins and blood is diverted deeper where the body can retain more of the heat.</p>
<p id="fs-id1589579">The &#8220;Voyage of Discovery&#8221; analogy and stick drawings mentioned earlier remain valid techniques for the study of systemic veins, but veins present a more difficult challenge because there are numerous anastomoses and multiple branches. It is like following a river with many tributaries and channels, several of which interconnect. Tracing blood flow through arteries follows the current in the direction of blood flow, so that we move from the heart through the large arteries and into the smaller arteries to the capillaries. From the capillaries, we move into the smallest veins and follow the direction of blood flow into larger veins and back to the heart. <a href="#fig-ch21_05_14" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> outlines the path of the major systemic veins.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-id1553916">The right atrium receives all of the systemic venous return. Most of the blood flows into either the superior vena cava or inferior vena cava. If you draw an imaginary line at the level of the diaphragm, systemic venous circulation from above that line will generally flow into the superior vena cava; this includes blood from the head, neck, chest, shoulders, and upper limbs. The exception to this is that most venous blood flow from the coronary veins flows directly into the coronary sinus and from there directly into the right atrium. Beneath the diaphragm, systemic venous flow enters the inferior vena cava, that is, blood from the abdominal and pelvic regions and the lower limbs.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1463351"><h4 data-type="title">The Superior Vena Cava</h4><p id="fs-id1965678">The <span data-type="term">superior vena cava</span> drains most of the body superior to the diaphragm (<a href="#fig-ch21_05_15" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). On both the left and right sides, the <span data-type="term">subclavian vein</span> forms when the axillary vein passes through the body wall from the axillary region. It fuses with the external and internal jugular veins from the head and neck to form the <span data-type="term">brachiocephalic vein</span>. Each <span data-type="term">vertebral vein</span> also flows into the brachiocephalic vein close to this fusion. These veins arise from the base of the brain and the cervical region of the spinal cord, and flow largely through the intervertebral foramina in the cervical vertebrae. They are the counterparts of the vertebral arteries. Each <span data-type="term">internal thoracic vein</span>, also known as an internal mammary vein, drains the anterior surface of the chest wall and flows into the brachiocephalic vein.</p>
<p id="fs-id2589135">The remainder of the blood supply from the thorax drains into the azygos vein. Each <span data-type="term">intercostal vein</span> drains muscles of the thoracic wall, each <span data-type="term">esophageal vein</span> delivers blood from the inferior portions of the esophagus, each <span data-type="term">bronchial vein</span> drains the systemic circulation from the lungs, and several smaller veins drain the mediastinal region. Bronchial veins carry approximately 13 percent of the blood that flows into the bronchial arteries; the remainder intermingles with the pulmonary circulation and returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins. These veins flow into the <span data-type="term">azygos vein</span>, and with the smaller <span data-type="term">hemiazygos vein</span> (hemi- = &#8220;half&#8221;) on the left of the vertebral column, drain blood from the thoracic region. The hemiazygos vein does not drain directly into the superior vena cava but enters the brachiocephalic vein via the superior intercostal vein.</p>
<p id="fs-id2111270">The azygos vein passes through the diaphragm from the thoracic cavity on the right side of the vertebral column and begins in the lumbar region of the thoracic cavity. It flows into the superior vena cava at approximately the level of T2, making a significant contribution to the flow of blood.

Many smaller veins of the brain stem and the superficial veins of the cerebrum lead to larger vessels referred to as intracranial sinuses. These include the superior and inferior sagittal sinuses, straight sinus, cavernous sinuses, left and right sinuses, the petrosal sinuses, and the occipital sinuses. Ultimately, sinuses will lead back to either the inferior jugular vein or vertebral vein.</p>
<p id="fs-id977085">Most of the veins on the superior surface of the cerebrum flow into the largest of the sinuses, the <span data-type="term">superior sagittal sinus</span>. It is located midsagittally between the meningeal and periosteal layers of the dura mater within the falx cerebri and, at first glance in images or models, can be mistaken for the subarachnoid space. Most reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid occurs via the chorionic villi (arachnoid granulations) into the superior sagittal sinus. Blood from most of the smaller vessels originating from the inferior cerebral veins flows into the <span data-type="term">great cerebral vein</span> and into the <span data-type="term">straight sinus</span>.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2937896"><h3 data-type="title">Hepatic Portal System</h3>
<p id="fs-id2380438">The liver is a complex biochemical processing plant. It packages nutrients absorbed by the digestive system; produces plasma proteins, clotting factors, and bile; and disposes of worn-out cell components and waste products. Instead of entering the circulation directly, absorbed nutrients and certain wastes (for example, materials produced by the spleen) travel to the liver for processing. They do so via the <span data-type="term">hepatic portal system</span> (<a href="#fig-ch21_05_22" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Portal systems begin and end in capillaries. In this case, the initial capillaries from the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and spleen lead to the hepatic portal vein and end in specialized capillaries within the liver, the hepatic sinusoids. You saw the only other portal system with the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal vessel in the endocrine chapter.</p>
<p id="fs-id2590067">The hepatic portal system consists of the hepatic portal vein and the veins that drain into it. The hepatic portal vein itself is relatively short, beginning at the level of L2 with the confluence of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins. It also receives branches from the inferior mesenteric vein, plus the splenic veins and all their tributaries. The superior mesenteric vein receives blood from the small intestine, two-thirds of the large intestine, and the stomach. The inferior mesenteric vein drains the distal third of the large intestine, including the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum. The splenic vein is formed from branches from the spleen, pancreas, and portions of the stomach, and the inferior mesenteric vein. After its formation, the hepatic portal vein also receives branches from the gastric veins of the stomach and cystic veins from the gall bladder. The hepatic portal vein delivers materials from these digestive and circulatory organs directly to the liver for processing.</p>
<p id="fs-id669716">Because of the hepatic portal system, the liver receives its blood supply from two different sources: from normal systemic circulation via the hepatic artery and from the hepatic portal vein. The liver processes the blood from the portal system to remove certain wastes and excess nutrients, which are stored for later use. This processed blood, as well as the systemic blood that came from the hepatic artery, exits the liver via the right, left, and middle hepatic veins, and flows into the inferior vena cava. Overall systemic blood composition remains relatively stable, since the liver is able to metabolize the absorbed digestive components.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch21_05_22"><div data-type="title">Hepatic Portal System </div><figcaption>The liver receives blood from the normal systemic circulation via the hepatic artery. It also receives and processes blood from other organs, delivered via the veins of the hepatic portal system. All blood exits the liver via the hepatic vein, which delivers the blood to the inferior vena cava.

<p id="fs-id2162736">The right ventricle pumps oxygen-depleted blood into the pulmonary trunk and right and left pulmonary arteries, which carry it to the right and left lungs for gas exchange. Oxygen-rich blood is transported by pulmonary veins to the left atrium. The left ventricle pumps this blood into the aorta. The main regions of the aorta are the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta, which is further divided into the thoracic and abdominal aorta. The coronary arteries branch from the ascending aorta. After oxygenating tissues in the capillaries, systemic blood is returned to the right atrium from the venous system via the superior vena cava, which drains most of the veins superior to the diaphragm, the inferior vena cava, which drains most of the veins inferior to the diaphragm, and the coronary veins via the coronary sinus. The hepatic portal system carries blood to the liver for processing before it enters circulation. Review the figures provided in this section for circulation of blood through the blood vessels.</p>
