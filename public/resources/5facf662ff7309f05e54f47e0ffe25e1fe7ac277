<title>Alcohols</title>
<para id="fs-idm66465552">Incorporation of an oxygen atom into carbon- and hydrogen-containing molecules leads to new functional groups and new families of compounds. When the oxygen atom is attached by single bonds, the molecule is either an alcohol or ether.</para>
<para id="fs-idm33604032"><term>Alcohols</term> are derivatives of hydrocarbons in which an –OH group has replaced a hydrogen atom. Although all alcohols have one or more hydroxyl (–OH) functional groups, they do not behave like bases such as NaOH and KOH. NaOH and KOH are ionic compounds that contain OH<sup>–</sup> ions. Alcohols are covalent molecules; the –OH group in an alcohol molecule is attached to a carbon atom by a covalent bond.</para>

<title>Naming Alcohols</title>
<para id="fs-idm24572576">The name of an alcohol comes from the hydrocarbon from which it was derived. The final <emphasis effect="italics">-e</emphasis> in the name of the hydrocarbon is replaced by <emphasis effect="italics">-ol</emphasis>, and the carbon atom to which the –OH group is bonded is indicated by a number placed before the name.<footnote id="fs-idp7176752">The IUPAC adopted new nomenclature guidelines in 2013 that require this number to be placed as an “infix” rather than a prefix. For example, the new name for 2-propanol would be propan-2-ol. Widespread adoption of this new nomenclature will take some time, and students are encouraged to be familiar with both the old and new naming protocols.</footnote></para>

The carbon chain contains five carbon atoms. If the hydroxyl group was not present, we would have named this molecule pentane. To address the fact that the hydroxyl group is present, we change the ending of the name to <emphasis effect="italics">-ol</emphasis>. In this case, since the –OH is attached to carbon 2 in the chain, we would name this molecule 2-pentanol.</para>

<title>Ethers</title>
<para id="fs-idp6654240"><term>Ethers</term> are compounds that contain the functional group –O–. Ethers do not have a designated suffix like the other types of molecules we have named so far. In the IUPAC system, the oxygen atom and the smaller carbon branch are named as an alkoxy substituent and the remainder of the molecule as the base chain, as in alkanes. As shown in the following compound, the red symbols represent the smaller alkyl group and the oxygen atom, which would be named “methoxy.” The larger carbon branch would be ethane, making the molecule methoxyethane. Many ethers are referred to with common names instead of the IUPAC system names. For common names, the two branches connected to the oxygen atom are named separately and followed by “ether.” The common name for the compound shown in <link target-id="fs-idm48177328"/> is ethylmethyl ether:</para>

<para id="fs-idp6657008">In the general formula for ethers, R—<emphasis class="emphasis-one">O</emphasis>—R, the hydrocarbon groups (R) may be the same or different. Diethyl ether, the most widely used compound of this class, is a colorless, volatile liquid that is highly flammable. It was first used in 1846 as an anesthetic, but better anesthetics have now largely taken its place. Diethyl ether and other ethers are presently used primarily as solvents for gums, fats, waxes, and resins. <emphasis effect="italics">Tertiary</emphasis>-butyl methyl ether, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub> (abbreviated MTBE—italicized portions of names are not counted when ranking the groups alphabetically—so butyl comes before methyl in the common name), is used as an additive for gasoline.

<title>Carbohydrates and Diabetes</title>
<para id="fs-idm73541184">Carbohydrates are large biomolecules made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The dietary forms of carbohydrates are foods rich in these types of molecules, like pastas, bread, and candy. The name “carbohydrate” comes from the formula of the molecules, which can be described by the general formula C<sub>m</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>, which shows that they are in a sense “carbon and water” or “hydrates of carbon.” In many cases, <emphasis effect="italics">m</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> have the same value, but they can be different. The smaller carbohydrates are generally referred to as “sugars,” the biochemical term for this group of molecules is “saccharide” from the Greek word for sugar (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_20_02_Sugars"/>). Depending on the number of sugar units joined together, they may be classified as monosaccharides (one sugar unit), disaccharides (two sugar units), oligosaccharides (a few sugars), or polysaccharides (the polymeric version of sugars—polymers were described in the feature box earlier in this chapter on recycling plastics). The scientific names of sugars can be recognized by the suffix <emphasis effect="italics">-ose</emphasis> at the end of the name (for instance, fruit sugar is a monosaccharide called “fructose” and milk sugar is a disaccharide called lactose composed of two monosaccharides, glucose and galactose, connected together). Sugars contain some of the functional groups we have discussed: Note the alcohol groups present in the structures and how monosaccharide units are linked to form a disaccharide by formation of an ether.</para>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_20_02_Sugars">
<media id="fs-idm37156032" alt="This figure shows structural and ball-and-stick models for the common sugars fructose and lactose. Carbon atoms are illustrated in black, oxygen atoms are red, and hydrogen atoms are white in the ball-and-stick models.">

<caption>The illustrations show the molecular structures of fructose, a five-carbon monosaccharide, and of lactose, a disaccharide composed of two isomeric, six-carbon sugars.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm33645104">Organisms use carbohydrates for a variety of functions. Carbohydrates can store energy, such as the polysaccharides glycogen in animals or starch in plants. They also provide structural support, such as the polysaccharide cellulose in plants and the modified polysaccharide chitin in fungi and animals. The sugars ribose and deoxyribose are components of the backbones of RNA and DNA, respectively. Other sugars play key roles in the function of the immune system, in cell-cell recognition, and in many other biological roles.</para>
<para id="fs-idm20354000">Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has a high sugar concentration in their blood (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_20_02_Diabetes"/>). Diabetes may be caused by insufficient insulin production by the pancreas or by the body’s cells not responding properly to the insulin that is produced. In a healthy person, insulin is produced when it is needed and functions to transport glucose from the blood into the cells where it can be used for energy. The long-term complications of diabetes can include loss of eyesight, heart disease, and kidney failure.</para>
<para id="fs-idm13367296">In 2013, it was estimated that approximately 3.3% of the world’s population (~380 million people) suffered from diabetes, resulting in over a million deaths annually. Prevention involves eating a healthy diet, getting plenty of exercise, and maintaining a normal body weight. Treatment involves all of these lifestyle practices and may require injections of insulin.</para>

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<para id="fs-idm8778416">Many organic compounds that are not hydrocarbons can be thought of as derivatives of hydrocarbons. A hydrocarbon derivative can be formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon by a functional group, which contains at least one atom of an element other than carbon or hydrogen. The properties of hydrocarbon derivatives are determined largely by the functional group. The –OH group is the functional group of an alcohol. The –R–O–R– group is the functional group of an ether.</para>
