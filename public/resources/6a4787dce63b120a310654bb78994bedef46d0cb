<p id="fs-id2473278">Anatomists and health care providers use terminology that can be bewildering to the uninitiated. However, the purpose of this language is not to confuse, but rather to increase precision and reduce medical errors. For example, is a scar &#8220;above the wrist&#8221; located on the forearm two or three inches away from the hand? Or is it at the base of the hand? Is it on the palm-side or back-side? By using precise anatomical terminology, we eliminate ambiguity. Anatomical terms derive from ancient Greek and Latin words. Because these languages are no longer used in everyday conversation, the meaning of their words does not change.</p>
<p id="fs-id2523539">Anatomical terms are made up of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. The root of a term often refers to an organ, tissue, or condition, whereas the prefix or suffix often describes the root. For example, in the disorder hypertension, the prefix &#8220;hyper-&#8221; means &#8220;high&#8221; or &#8220;over,&#8221; and the root word &#8220;tension&#8221; refers to pressure, so the word &#8220;hypertension&#8221; refers to abnormally high blood pressure.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1932675"><h3 data-type="title">Anatomical Position</h3>
<p id="fs-id2295576">To further increase precision, anatomists standardize the way in which they view the body. Just as maps are normally oriented with north at the top, the standard body &#8220;map,&#8221; or <span data-type="term">anatomical position</span>, is that of the body standing upright, with the feet at shoulder width and parallel, toes forward. The upper limbs are held out to each side, and the palms of the hands face forward as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch01_06_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Using this standard position reduces confusion. It does not matter how the body being described is oriented, the terms are used as if it is in anatomical position. For example, a scar in the &#8220;anterior (front) carpal (wrist) region&#8221; would be present on the palm side of the wrist. The term &#8220;anterior&#8221; would be used even if the hand were palm down on a table.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2661204"><h3 data-type="title">Regional Terms</h3>
<p id="fs-id2200372">The human body&#8217;s numerous regions have specific terms to help increase precision (see <a href="#fig-ch01_06_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Notice that the term &#8220;brachium&#8221; or &#8220;arm&#8221; is reserved for the &#8220;upper arm&#8221; and &#8220;antebrachium&#8221; or &#8220;forearm&#8221; is used rather than &#8220;lower arm.&#8221; Similarly, &#8220;femur&#8221; or &#8220;thigh&#8221; is correct, and &#8220;leg&#8221; or &#8220;crus&#8221; is reserved for the portion of the lower limb between the knee and the ankle. You will be able to describe the body&#8217;s regions using the terms from the figure.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2138527"><h3 data-type="title">Directional Terms</h3>
<p id="fs-id2146154">Certain directional anatomical terms appear throughout this and any other anatomy textbook (<a href="#fig-ch01_06_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). These terms are essential for describing the relative locations of different body structures. For instance, an anatomist might describe one band of tissue as &#8220;inferior to&#8221; another or a physician might describe a tumor as &#8220;superficial to&#8221; a deeper body structure. Commit these terms to memory to avoid confusion when you are studying or describing the locations of particular body parts.</p>
<ul id="fs-id1898112">

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2576027"><h3 data-type="title">Body Planes</h3>
<p id="fs-id1530377">A <span data-type="term">section</span> is a two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional structure that has been cut. Modern medical imaging devices enable clinicians to obtain &#8220;virtual sections&#8221; of living bodies. We call these scans. Body sections and scans can be correctly interpreted, however, only if the viewer understands the plane along which the section was made. A <span data-type="term">plane</span> is an imaginary two-dimensional surface that passes through the body. There are three planes commonly referred to in anatomy and medicine, as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch01_06_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>
<ul id="fs-id2025531">
<li>The <span data-type="term">sagittal plane</span> is the plane that divides the body or an organ vertically into right and left sides. If this vertical plane runs directly down the middle of the body, it is called the midsagittal or median plane. If it divides the body into unequal right and left sides, it is called a parasagittal plane or less commonly a longitudinal section.</li>
<li>The <span data-type="term">frontal plane</span> is the plane that divides the body or an organ into an anterior (front) portion and a posterior (rear) portion. The frontal plane is often referred to as a coronal plane. (&#8220;Corona&#8221; is Latin for &#8220;crown.&#8221;)</li>
<li>The <span data-type="term">transverse plane</span> is the plane that divides the body or organ horizontally into upper and lower portions. Transverse planes produce images referred to as cross sections.</li></ul>

<p id="fs-id1959778">The body maintains its internal organization by means of membranes, sheaths, and other structures that separate compartments. The <span data-type="term">dorsal (posterior) cavity</span> and the <span data-type="term">ventral (anterior) cavity</span> are the largest body compartments (<a href="#fig-ch01_06_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). These cavities contain and protect delicate internal organs, and the ventral cavity allows for significant changes in the size and shape of the organs as they perform their functions. The lungs, heart, stomach, and intestines, for example, can expand and contract without distorting other tissues or disrupting the activity of nearby organs.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch01_06_04"><div data-type="title">Dorsal and Ventral Body Cavities</div><figcaption>The ventral cavity includes the thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities and their subdivisions.

Together the cranial cavity and vertebral cavity can be referred to as the dorsal body cavity. The thoracic cavity consists of three cavities that fill the interior area of the chest. The two pleural cavities are situated on both sides of the body, anterior to the spine and lateral to the breastbone. The superior mediastinum is a wedge-shaped cavity located between the superior regions of the two thoracic cavities. The pericardial cavity within the mediastinum is located at the center of the chest below the superior mediastinum. The pericardial cavity roughly outlines the shape of the heart.

<p id="fs-id2761919">The posterior (dorsal) and anterior (ventral) cavities are each subdivided into smaller cavities. In the posterior (dorsal) cavity, the <span data-type="term">cranial cavity</span> houses the brain, and the <span data-type="term">spinal cavity</span> (or vertebral cavity) encloses the spinal cord. Just as the brain and spinal cord make up a continuous, uninterrupted structure, the cranial and spinal cavities that house them are also continuous. The brain and spinal cord are protected by the bones of the skull and vertebral column and by cerebrospinal fluid, a colorless fluid produced by the brain, which cushions the brain and spinal cord within the posterior (dorsal) cavity.</p>
<p id="fs-id1289832">The anterior (ventral) cavity has two main subdivisions: the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity (see <a href="#fig-ch01_06_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The <span data-type="term">thoracic cavity</span> is the more superior subdivision of the anterior cavity, and it is enclosed by the rib cage. The thoracic cavity contains the lungs and the heart, which is located in the mediastinum. The diaphragm forms the floor of the thoracic cavity and separates it from the more inferior abdominopelvic cavity. The <span data-type="term">abdominopelvic cavity</span> is the largest cavity in the body. Although no membrane physically divides the abdominopelvic cavity, it can be useful to distinguish between the abdominal cavity, the division that houses the digestive organs, and the pelvic cavity, the division that houses the organs of reproduction.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-id1465748">There are three serous cavities and their associated membranes. The <span data-type="term">pleura</span> is the serous membrane that encloses the pleural cavity; the pleural cavity surrounds the lungs.  The <span data-type="term">pericardium</span> is the serous membrane that encloses the pericardial cavity; the pericardial cavity surrounds the heart. The <span data-type="term">peritoneum</span> is the serous membrane that encloses the peritoneal cavity; the peritoneal cavity surrounds several organs in the abdominopelvic cavity. The serous membranes form fluid-filled sacs, or cavities, that are meant to cushion and reduce friction on internal organs when they move, such as when the lungs inflate or the heart beats. Both the parietal and visceral serosa secrete the thin, slippery serous fluid located within the serous cavities. The pleural cavity reduces friction between the lungs and the body wall. Likewise, the pericardial cavity reduces friction between the heart and the wall of the pericardium. The peritoneal cavity reduces friction between the abdominal and pelvic organs and the body wall. Therefore, serous membranes provide additional protection to the viscera they enclose by reducing friction that could lead to inflammation of the organs.</p></section>

<p id="fs-id2103934">Ancient Greek and Latin words are used to build anatomical terms. A standard reference position for mapping the body&#8217;s structures is the normal anatomical position. Regions of the body are identified using terms such as &#8220;occipital&#8221; that are more precise than common words and phrases such as &#8220;the back of the head.&#8221; Directional terms such as anterior and posterior are essential for accurately describing the relative locations of body structures. Images of the body&#8217;s interior commonly align along one of three planes: the sagittal, frontal, or transverse. The body&#8217;s organs are organized in one of two main cavities&#8212;dorsal (also referred to posterior) and ventral (also referred to anterior)&#8212;which are further sub-divided according to the structures present in each area. The serous membranes have two layers&#8212;parietal and visceral&#8212;surrounding a fluid filled space. Serous membranes cover the lungs (pleural serosa), heart (pericardial serosa), and some abdominopelvic organs (peritoneal serosa).</p>
