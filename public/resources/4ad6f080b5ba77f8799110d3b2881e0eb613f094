These forces are primarily responsible for the physical properties exhibited by the bulk solids. The following sections provide descriptions of the major types of crystalline solids: ionic, metallic, covalent network, and molecular.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp89902960"><h3 data-type="title">Ionic Solids</h3>
<p id="fs-idp61138560"><span data-type="term">Ionic solids</span>, such as sodium chloride and nickel oxide, are composed of positive and negative ions that are held together by electrostatic attractions, which can be quite strong (<a href="#CNX_Chem_10_05_IonicSolid" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Many ionic crystals also have high melting points. This is due to the very strong attractions between the ions&#8212;in ionic compounds, the attractions between full charges are (much) larger than those between the partial charges in polar molecular compounds. This will be looked at in more detail in a later discussion of lattice energies. Although they are hard, they also tend to be brittle, and they shatter rather than bend. Ionic solids do not conduct electricity; however, they do conduct when molten or dissolved because their ions are free to move. Many simple compounds formed by the reaction of a metallic element with a nonmetallic element are ionic.</p>

<p id="fs-idp89753840"><span data-type="term">Metallic solids</span> such as crystals of copper, aluminum, and iron are formed by metal atoms <a href="#CNX_Chem_10_05_Metallic" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The structure of metallic crystals is often described as a uniform distribution of atomic nuclei within a &#8220;sea&#8221; of delocalized electrons. The atoms within such a metallic solid are held together by a unique force known as <em data-effect="italics">metallic bonding</em> that gives rise to many useful and varied bulk properties. All exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivity, metallic luster, and malleability. Many are very hard and quite strong. Because of their malleability (the ability to deform under pressure or hammering), they do not shatter and, therefore, make useful construction materials. The melting points of the metals vary widely. Mercury is a liquid at room temperature, and the alkali metals melt below 200 &#176;C. Several post-transition metals also have low melting points, whereas the transition metals melt at temperatures above 1000 &#176;C. These differences reflect differences in strengths of metallic bonding among the metals.</p>

<p id="fs-idm59353248"><span data-type="term">Covalent network solids</span> include crystals of diamond, silicon, some other nonmetals, and some covalent compounds such as silicon dioxide (sand) and silicon carbide (carborundum, the abrasive on sandpaper). Many minerals have networks of covalent bonds. The atoms in these solids are held together by a network of covalent bonds, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_10_05_NtwrkSolid" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. To break or to melt a covalent network solid, covalent bonds must be broken. Because covalent bonds are relatively strong, covalent network solids are typically characterized by hardness, strength, and high melting points. For example, diamond is one of the hardest substances known and melts above 3500 &#176;C.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm126346448"><h3 data-type="title">Properties of Solids</h3>
<p id="fs-idp69161920">A crystalline solid, like those listed in <a href="#fs-idp121853232" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, has a precise melting temperature because each atom or molecule of the same type is held in place with the same forces or energy. Thus, the attractions between the units that make up the crystal all have the same strength and all require the same amount of energy to be broken. The gradual softening of an amorphous material differs dramatically from the distinct melting of a crystalline solid. This results from the structural nonequivalence of the molecules in the amorphous solid. Some forces are weaker than others, and when an amorphous material is heated, the weakest intermolecular attractions break first. As the temperature is increased further, the stronger attractions are broken. Thus amorphous materials soften over a range of temperatures.</p>

The main types of crystalline solids are ionic solids, metallic solids, covalent network solids, and molecular solids. The properties of the different kinds of crystalline solids are due to the types of particles of which they consist, the arrangements of the particles, and the strengths of the attractions between them. Because their particles experience identical attractions, crystalline solids have distinct melting temperatures; the particles in amorphous solids experience a range of interactions, so they soften gradually and melt over a range of temperatures. Some crystalline solids have defects in the definite repeating pattern of their particles. These defects (which include vacancies, atoms or ions not in the regular positions, and impurities) change physical properties such as electrical conductivity, which is exploited in the silicon crystals used to manufacture computer chips.</p>

<p id="fs-idp75942032">Explain why ice, which is a crystalline solid, has a melting temperature of 0 &#176;C, whereas butter, which is an amorphous solid, softens over a range of temperatures.</p>
</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-idm138844688">
<p id="fs-idm74685056">Ice has a crystalline structure stabilized by hydrogen bonding. These intermolecular forces are of comparable strength and thus require the same amount of energy to overcome. As a result, ice melts at a single temperature and not over a range of temperatures. The various, very large molecules that compose butter experience varied van der Waals attractions of various strengths that are overcome at various temperatures, and so the melting process occurs over a wide temperature range.</p>
