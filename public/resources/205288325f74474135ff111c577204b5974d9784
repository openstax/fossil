<p id="fs-idp15190992">Thinking in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals is one way for us to explain how chemical bonds form in diatomic molecules. However, to understand how molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. As an example, let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to two hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em><sup>2</sup>2<em data-effect="italics">s</em><sup>2</sup>2<em data-effect="italics">p</em><sup>4</sup>, with two unpaired electrons (one in each of the two 2<em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two O&#8211;H bonds form from the overlap of these two 2<em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals with the 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If this were the case, the bond angle would be 90&#176;, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Chem_08_02_H2Ovb" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, because <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals are perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is 104.5&#176;, not 90&#176;. The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed.</p>

<p id="fs-idm11485424">Quantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in H<sub>2</sub>O differ from those predicted by the overlap of the 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital of the hydrogen atoms with the 2<em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave function, <em data-effect="italics">&#968;</em>, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called <span data-type="term">hybridization</span> and is mathematically accomplished by the <em data-effect="italics">linear combination of atomic orbitals</em>, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called <span data-type="term">hybrid orbitals</span>. The valence orbitals in an <em data-effect="italics">isolated</em> oxygen atom are a 2<em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital and three 2<em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (<a href="#CNX_Chem_08_02_H2Otet" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a tetrahedral bond angle (109.5&#176;). The observed angle of 104.5&#176; is experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate predictions.</p>

<p id="fs-idm27133328">The following ideas are important in understanding hybridization:</p>
<ol id="fs-idm26101008" type="1">
<li>Hybrid orbitals do not exist in isolated atoms. They are formed only in covalently bonded atoms.</li>
<li>Hybrid orbitals have shapes and orientations that are very different from those of the atomic orbitals in isolated atoms.</li>
<li>A set of hybrid orbitals is generated by combining atomic orbitals. The number of hybrid orbitals in a set is equal to the number of atomic orbitals that were combined to produce the set.</li>
<li>All orbitals in a set of hybrid orbitals are equivalent in shape and energy.</li>
<li>The type of hybrid orbitals formed in a bonded atom depends on its electron-pair geometry as predicted by the VSEPR theory.</li>
<li>Hybrid orbitals overlap to form &#963; bonds. Unhybridized orbitals overlap to form &#960; bonds.</li>

<p id="fs-idp208078752">The beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl<sub>2</sub> molecule is an example of a central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in a linear arrangement of three atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl<sub>2</sub> molecule that correspond to the two covalent Be&#8211;Cl bonds. To accommodate these two electron domains, two of the Be atom&#8217;s four valence orbitals will mix to yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the valence <em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital with one of the valence <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals to yield two equivalent <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">sp</em> hybrid orbitals</span> that are oriented in a linear geometry (<a href="#CNX_Chem_08_02_spGeom" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). In this figure, the set of <em data-effect="italics">sp</em> orbitals appears similar in shape to the original <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbital, but there is an important difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number of hybrid orbitals formed. The <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbital is one orbital that can hold up to two electrons. The <em data-effect="italics">sp</em> set is two equivalent orbitals that point 180&#176; from each other. The two electrons that were originally in the <em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital are now distributed to the two <em data-effect="italics">sp</em> orbitals, which are half filled.

<li>Determine the number of regions of electron density around an atom using VSEPR theory, in which single bonds, multiple bonds, radicals, and lone pairs each count as one region.</li>

<p id="fs-idp61891472">It is important to remember that hybridization was devised to rationalize experimentally observed molecular geometries. The model works well for molecules containing small central atoms, in which the valence electron pairs are close together in space. However, for larger central atoms, the valence-shell electron pairs are farther from the nucleus, and there are fewer repulsions. Their compounds exhibit structures that are often not consistent with VSEPR theory, and hybridized orbitals are not necessary to explain the observed data. For example, we have discussed the H&#8211;O&#8211;H bond angle in H<sub>2</sub>O, 104.5&#176;, which is more consistent with <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals (109.5&#176;) on the central atom than with 2<em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals (90&#176;). Sulfur is in the same group as oxygen, and H<sub>2</sub>S has a similar Lewis structure. However, it has a much smaller bond angle (92.1&#176;), which indicates much less hybridization on sulfur than oxygen. Continuing down the group, tellurium is even larger than sulfur, and for H<sub>2</sub>Te, the observed bond angle (90&#176;) is consistent with overlap of the 5<em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals, without invoking hybridization. We invoke hybridization where it is necessary to explain the observed structures.</p>

<p id="fs-idm25402912">We can use hybrid orbitals, which are mathematical combinations of some or all of the valence atomic orbitals, to describe the electron density around covalently bonded atoms. These hybrid orbitals either form sigma (&#963;) bonds directed toward other atoms of the molecule or contain lone pairs of electrons. We can determine the type of hybridization around a central atom from the geometry of the regions of electron density about it. Two such regions imply <em data-effect="italics">sp</em> hybridization; three, <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>2</sup> hybridization; four, <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>3</sup> hybridization; five, <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>3</sup><em data-effect="italics">d</em> hybridization; and six, <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>3</sup><em data-effect="italics">d</em><sup>2</sup> hybridization.
