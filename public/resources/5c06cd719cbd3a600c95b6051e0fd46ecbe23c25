<para id="fs-idp15190992">Thinking in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals is one way for us to explain how chemical bonds form in diatomic molecules. However, to understand how molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. As an example, let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to two hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration 1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis><sup>2</sup>2<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis><sup>2</sup>2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis><sup>4</sup>, with two unpaired electrons (one in each of the two 2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two O–H bonds form from the overlap of these two 2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals with the 1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If this were the case, the bond angle would be 90°, as shown in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_08_02_H2Ovb"/>, because <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals are perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is 104.5°, not 90°. The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed.</para>

<caption>The hypothetical overlap of two of the 2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals on an oxygen atom (red) with the 1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> orbitals of two hydrogen atoms (blue) would produce a bond angle of 90°. This is not consistent with experimental evidence.<footnote id="fs-idm75980880">Note that orbitals may sometimes be drawn in an elongated “balloon” shape rather than in a more realistic “plump” shape in order to make the geometry easier to visualize.</footnote></caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm11485424">Quantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in H<sub>2</sub>O differ from those predicted by the overlap of the 1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> orbital of the hydrogen atoms with the 2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave function, <emphasis effect="italics">ψ</emphasis>, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called <term>hybridization</term> and is mathematically accomplished by the <emphasis effect="italics">linear combination of atomic orbitals</emphasis>, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called <term>hybrid orbitals</term>. The valence orbitals in an <emphasis effect="italics">isolated</emphasis> oxygen atom are a 2<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> orbital and three 2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_08_02_H2Otet"/>). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a tetrahedral bond angle (109.5°). The observed angle of 104.5° is experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate predictions.</para>

<para id="fs-idp208078752">The beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl<sub>2</sub> molecule is an example of a central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in a linear arrangement of three atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl<sub>2</sub> molecule that correspond to the two covalent Be–Cl bonds. To accommodate these two electron domains, two of the Be atom’s four valence orbitals will mix to yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the valence <emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> orbital with one of the valence <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals to yield two equivalent <term><emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis> hybrid orbitals</term> that are oriented in a linear geometry (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_08_02_spGeom"/>). In this figure, the set of <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis> orbitals appears similar in shape to the original <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbital, but there is an important difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number of hybrid orbitals formed. The <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbital is one orbital that can hold up to two electrons. The <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis> set is two equivalent orbitals that point 180° from each other. The two electrons that were originally in the <emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> orbital are now distributed to the two <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis> orbitals, which are half filled. In gaseous BeCl<sub>2</sub>, these half-filled hybrid orbitals will overlap with orbitals from the chlorine atoms to form two identical σ bonds.</para>

<para id="fs-idp61891472">It is important to remember that hybridization was devised to rationalize experimentally observed molecular geometries. The model works well for molecules containing small central atoms, in which the valence electron pairs are close together in space. However, for larger central atoms, the valence-shell electron pairs are farther from the nucleus, and there are fewer repulsions. Their compounds exhibit structures that are often not consistent with VSEPR theory, and hybridized orbitals are not necessary to explain the observed data. For example, we have discussed the H–O–H bond angle in H<sub>2</sub>O, 104.5°, which is more consistent with <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals (109.5°) on the central atom than with 2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals (90°). Sulfur is in the same group as oxygen, and H<sub>2</sub>S has a similar Lewis structure. However, it has a much smaller bond angle (92.1°), which indicates much less hybridization on sulfur than oxygen. Continuing down the group, tellurium is even larger than sulfur, and for H<sub>2</sub>Te, the observed bond angle (90°) is consistent with overlap of the 5<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals, without invoking hybridization.
