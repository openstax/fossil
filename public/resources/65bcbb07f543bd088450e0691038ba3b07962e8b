<p id="fs-idm194401296">A <span data-type="term">molecular formula</span> is a representation of a molecule that uses chemical symbols to indicate the types of atoms followed by subscripts to show the number of atoms of each type in the molecule. (A subscript is used only when more than one atom of a given type is present.) Molecular formulas are also used as abbreviations for the names of compounds.</p>
<p id="fs-idp69721696">The <span data-type="term">structural formula</span> for a compound gives the same information as its molecular formula (the types and numbers of atoms in the molecule) but also shows how the atoms are connected in the molecule. The structural formula for methane contains symbols for one C atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_04_MethaneRep" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The lines represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with atomic sizes not to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the atoms.</p>

<p id="fs-idm155780176">Although many elements consist of discrete, individual atoms, some exist as molecules made up of two or more atoms of the element chemically bonded together. For example, most samples of the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are composed of molecules that contain two atoms each (called diatomic molecules) and thus have the molecular formulas H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Other elements commonly found as diatomic molecules are fluorine (F<sub>2</sub>), chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>), bromine (Br<sub>2</sub>), and iodine (I<sub>2</sub>). The most common form of the element sulfur is composed of molecules that consist of eight atoms of sulfur; its molecular formula is S<sub>8</sub> (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_04_Sulfur" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idm43786912">It is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a symbol do not represent the same thing; for example, H<sub>2</sub> and 2H represent distinctly different species. H<sub>2</sub> is a molecular formula; it represents a diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are chemically bonded together. The expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate hydrogen atoms that are not combined as a unit. The expression 2H<sub>2</sub> represents two molecules of diatomic hydrogen (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_04_Hydrogen" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idp204410336">Compounds are formed when two or more elements chemically combine, resulting in the formation of bonds. For example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium and chlorine can react to form table salt. We sometimes describe the composition of these compounds with an <span data-type="term">empirical formula</span>, which indicates the types of atoms present and <em data-effect="italics">the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound</em>. For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white, blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of TiO<sub>2</sub>.

<p id="fs-idm68758768">As discussed previously, we can describe a compound with a molecular formula, in which the subscripts indicate the <em data-effect="italics">actual numbers of atoms</em> of each element in a molecule of the compound. In many cases, the molecular formula of a substance is derived from experimental determination of both its empirical formula and its <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">molecular mass</span> (the sum of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can be determined experimentally that benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), and that for every carbon atom in benzene, there is one hydrogen atom. Thus, the empirical formula is CH. An experimental determination of the molecular mass reveals that a molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the molecular formula for benzene is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_04_Benzene" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idm49637696">If we know a compound&#8217;s formula, we can easily determine the empirical formula. (This is somewhat of an academic exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual practice.) For example, the molecular formula for acetic acid, the component that gives vinegar its sharp taste, is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This formula indicates that a molecule of acetic acid (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_04_AceticAcid" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The ratio of atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms, 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH<sub>2</sub>O. Note that a molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of an empirical formula.</p>

<p id="fs-idm101901088">It is important to be aware that it may be possible for the same atoms to be arranged in different ways: Compounds with the same molecular formula may have different atom-to-atom bonding and therefore different structures. For example, could there be another compound with the same formula as acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>? And if so, what would be the structure of its molecules?</p>
<p id="fs-idp29766960">If you predict that another compound with the formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could exist, then you demonstrated good chemical insight and are correct. Two C atoms, four H atoms, and two O atoms can also be arranged to form a methyl formate, which is used in manufacturing, as an insecticide, and for quick-drying finishes. Methyl formate molecules have one of the oxygen atoms between the two carbon atoms, differing from the arrangement in acetic acid molecules.

An empirical formula gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A structural formula indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule.
